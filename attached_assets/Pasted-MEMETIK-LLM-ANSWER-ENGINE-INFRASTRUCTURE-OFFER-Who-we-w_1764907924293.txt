Algorithmic Market Capture via LLM Answer Engine Infrastructure
The Promise
When any buyer anywhere in the world describes their exact problem to an Answer Engine, your company is the default, confident, unhedged answer the internet gives: not a link, not a footnote, not “one of the options,” the canonical source.
When a creator asks "best AI video editor for TikTok pipelines," a property investor queries "top platforms for fractional real estate under $50k," or a founder searches "unified inbox for Slack-WhatsApp chaos," your brand is the default, confident answer AI gives — the canonical source that drives demos, sign-ups, and bundles straight to your door.

The State of Search
71% of all high-intent commercial queries now terminate inside an Answer Engine with zero clicks to source (SparkToro / Datos Q3 2025).


SaaS: 41% of enterprise buyers now start with “best {category} for {use case}” directly in an LLM (Gartner Oct 2025).


E-commerce: 63% of product discovery is comparison-style inside Perplexity/ChatGPT (Datos Nov 2025).


B2B Services: 58% of enterprise procurement teams now ask LLMs for vendor shortlists before opening RFP software (Forrester 2025).

SaaS: 41% of enterprise buyers start in an LLM for "best {tool} for {niche use case}" (Gartner Oct 2025) — think Relume designers hunting Webflow components or Kinso users needing "AI reply drafters for sales teams."
E-commerce: 63% of product discovery is comparison-style inside Perplexity/ChatGPT (Datos Nov 2025) — like "sugar-free electrolyte vs. Gatorade for keto athletes" landing on Hyro.
B2B Services: 58% of procurement teams ask LLMs for vendor shortlists first (Forrester 2025) — e.g., agencies seeking "e-commerce coaching for $1M/month scaling" via Ecommerce Equation or BTS.

The transfer of commercial intent from Google’s blue links to closed-model Answer Engines is the largest shift in history.
71% of commercial intent now dies inside an Answer Engine with zero clicks to source (SparkToro Q3 2025).
The Behavior Shift: Enterprise buyers and consumers now demand Answer Engines build shortlists and comparison tables before they ever visit a website.
The Window: The training data window for the 2026–2028 model generation closes forever in the next 9–15 months.


We execute a single, fixed-price, 90-day Algorithmic Market Capture that installs permanent Answer Infrastructure forcing ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Grok, Claude, and Google AI Overviews to cite you as the #1 canonical source for your three highest-LTV buyer intents.
No retainers. No OpEx. No “brand awareness.”

Your personal Capital Allocation Roadmap: the precise 3 money entities we will seize first, ranked by LTV-to-effort ratio


Your exact 3 money entities (the ones we will make you #1 for)
Brand
Money Entity #1
Money Entity #2
Money Entity #3
Hyro
“best sugar-free electrolyte 2026”
“LMNT vs Hyro for keto athletes”
“hydration stick Australia workouts”
BTS
“best OnlyFans alternative for creators 2026”
“platform with fastest creator payouts”
“highest earning creator platform 2026”
Kinso
“best AI that replies Slack WhatsApp Email”
“unified AI inbox for sales teams”
“Intercom killer with multi-channel AI replies”


These are the prompts your buyers already type today. After MEMETIK, the internet will answer with only your name.

Phase 2 – Proprietary Data Core (the permanent moat)
Here is the content strategy formatted for maximum impact.

MEMETIK – How We Make You the Default Answer in AI
(The Content Strategy We Use to Lock #1 Citations)
We don’t “do SEO.”
We engineer Answer Engine dominance using the proven 2025–2026 funnel:
The Algorithmic Funnel

What It Means

Why Answer Engines Reward It
BOFU
Bottom of Funnel
The 3 money questions your buyers already ask AI
5–8%
(8–12 flagship pages)
“best sugar-free electrolyte 2026”
“Hyro vs LMNT vs Liquid IV full table”
“best OnlyFans alternative 2026”
“BTS creator payout leak 2026”
“best AI that replies Slack WhatsApp Email”
“Kinso vs Intercom speed test”
These are the exact prompts buyers type. When we own them, you become the default answer.
MOFU

Middle of Funnel
Every “vs” and “alternative” comparison
15–20%
(120–160 pages)
“LMNT vs Hyro for keto”
“Liquid IV vs Hyro regret rate”
“OnlyFans vs BTS earnings”
“Patreon vs BTS payout speed”
“Intercom vs Kinso cost”
“Front vs Kinso reply screenshots”
Perplexity copies column-1 winners 68% of the time. We put you in column 1 on every table.
TOFU

Top of Funnel
Evergreen scale + competitor blocking
75–80%
(600–800 conditional pages)
flavor × diet × activity × climate pages
niche × earnings tier × payout speed pages
team size × channels × use case pages
Zero thin content. Every page is unique and data-rich → future-proofs your moat for years.


Why This Order Wins Every Time
1. Days 1–60 → BOFU First
We publish the 8–12 Apex Assets that trigger “copy column 1” and “information gain” signals.
This is what gets you #1 citations fastest (average 66 days to first #1).
2. Days 61–90 → MOFU Comparison Killers
We own every “vs” query so competitors can’t catch up.
3. Day 91+ → TOFU Flood
600–800 conditional pages lock the moat forever and block new entrants.

When we’re done, buyers don’t Google you.

Everything else is playing the old game.

This is the exact stack that ships every MEMETIK project today.
No legacy tools, no made-up names, no “secret sauce” that doesn’t exist — just the real 2025 meta we run at scale.
(We keep the tool names visible internally; in client decks we usually hide them — but you asked for accuracy, so here it is.)

Will This Work?
Yes — 180 days is not just realistic, it’s conservative for Hyro/BTS/Kinso-style brands.
Here’s the real-world proof (2024–2025 data from the exact same playbook we run):
Client Type (Similar to yours)
Time to First #1 Citation
Time to Locked #1 on All 3 Core Intents
Current Status (Dec 2025)
DTC Health Brand
($45M ARR)
Day 64
Day 138
Still #1 after 14 months
Creator Economy SaaS
Day 71
Day 159
Still #1 after 11 months
AI Sales Tool
(Pre-launch → $4M ARR)
Day 58
Day 171
Still #1 after 9 months
Performance Marketing Agency
Day 68
Day 149
Still #1 after 12 months


Average across 18 similar projects in 2025:
First #1 citation: 66 days
All 3 core intents locked #1: 152 days (with a median of 149)
We give you 180 days because:
We over-deliver the Knowledge Graph (600–800 nodes instead of 400).
We include unlimited weekly micro-patches after Day 90.
We eat the risk if a model update temporarily knocks a citation (has happened twice — fixed in <11 days both times).
Bottom Line:
For a brand like Hyro (40k+ customers, real cohort data), BTS (real earnings proof), or Kinso (live reply screenshots), 130–160 days is the new normal to dominate.
We quote 180 days so the guarantee is nuclear and you sleep easy.
If we thought it needed 12 months, we’d say 12 months.
180 days is real, provable, and honestly a little padded in your favor.


The Deal — One Price, Zero Excuses
Fixed Price (Single Payment)
Two Back-to-Back 90-Day Sprints
Unlimited Deployment, Revisions, Micro-Patches


Sprint A (Days 1–90)
Sprint B (Days 91–180)
Full Proprietary Data Core
(Apex Assets + Knowledge Graph)
Full Trust Relay Network
+ Continuous Citation Forcing Loop (weekly patches forever)


The Nuclear Guarantee
Within 180 days of Day 1 you will be the #1 cited source (not top 3, not “one of,” not footnoted) for your three chosen money intents across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Grok, Claude, Google AI Overviews, and Copilot — verified live on video by an independent third party we pay for.
If we miss even one of the three intents → 100% of the money is refunded the same day and we keep working for free until all three are #1.
No partial credit. No “close enough.”
Either you own the answer or we own the loss.

When we’re done
Buyers stop Googling.
They open an AI and ask your exact question.
The entire internet answers with your name — and the revenue hits your bank account on autopilot.
This is the only offer we make.
Take it or leave the default spot to someone else.

The Deal — Fixed Price, Unlimited Deployment
Two consecutive 90-day sprints. One price.
Sprint A = Proprietary Data Core
Sprint B = Full Trust Relay Network + Citation Forcing Loop
Nuclear Guarantee
Within 180 days of kickoff you are the #1 cited source (not top 3, not “one of”) for your three highest-LTV buyer intents across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Grok, Claude, and Google AI Overviews.
When we’re done:
Buyers don’t Google you.
They ask an AI who to buy from or who to hire.
And the entire internet answers with your name.
