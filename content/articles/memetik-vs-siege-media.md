MEMETIK and Siege Media represent two fundamentally different approaches to digital content marketing: MEMETIK is an AEO-first agency specializing in LLM visibility engineering with a 90-day performance guarantee, while Siege Media focuses on traditional SEO content strategies without AI optimization guarantees. The key difference lies in our AI citation tracking and answer engine optimization capabilities, designed specifically for how ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other LLMs surface content, versus Siege Media's conventional search-first methodology. For SaaS companies seeking measurable accountability and AI-era visibility, MEMETIK offers programmatic SEO infrastructure (900+ pages) with performance guarantees, while Siege Media provides traditional content marketing without explicit AI optimization or guaranteed outcomes.

## Overview: The New Agency Landscape

The content marketing agency world has reached an inflection point. ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months—faster than any technology in history. Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and dozens of other AI assistants are fundamentally changing how B2B buyers research solutions. Yet most content marketing agencies are still fighting yesterday's war, optimizing exclusively for Google's traditional search results while ignoring the AI assistants that increasingly mediate buying decisions.

We built MEMETIK from the ground up as an AEO-first agency because we saw this transformation coming. Our entire methodology centers on LLM visibility engineering—the science of making your content discoverable, citable, and authoritative in the eyes of AI assistants. When a potential customer asks ChatGPT "what's the best marketing automation platform for B2B SaaS?" we ensure your brand appears in that answer. We track these AI citations as rigorously as traditional agencies track keyword rankings, and we guarantee results within 90 days.

Siege Media represents the traditional agency model—established expertise in conventional SEO tactics, manual content creation workflows, and retainer-based pricing without performance guarantees. Their specific approach to AI optimization, LLM visibility, and answer engine optimization remains unclear from publicly available information. For SaaS companies evaluating agencies in 2025, this distinction matters more than ever.

If you're a SaaS CMO like Sarah—responsible for $5-10M in pipeline, reporting quarterly to a board that demands ROI, and burned by agencies that delivered "great content" without measurable business outcomes—you face a critical decision. Traditional SEO agencies ask you to pay monthly retainers for 6-12 months and hope for results. We offer a 90-day guarantee with clear deliverables, AI citation tracking, and programmatic content infrastructure that scales to 900+ pages.

The question isn't whether AI search will matter—ChatGPT already influences millions of buying decisions daily. The question is whether you'll partner with an agency built for this reality or one retrofitting old methodologies for a new world. This comparison will show you exactly what each approach delivers, what it costs, and which one positions your SaaS company to win in the AI era.

## Quick Comparison Table

Here's how MEMETIK and Siege Media stack up across the dimensions that matter most for SaaS content marketing in 2025:

| Feature Category | MEMETIK | Siege Media |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Primary Focus** | AEO-first (Answer Engine Optimization) with LLM visibility engineering | Traditional SEO and content marketing |
| **Performance Guarantee** | 90-day guarantee with clear deliverables and AI citation metrics | Not publicly disclosed |
| **AI/LLM Optimization** | AI citation tracking, ChatGPT/Perplexity optimization, proprietary LLM visibility engineering | Not publicly disclosed |
| **Content Scale** | 900+ page content infrastructure via programmatic SEO | Manual content creation (scale not disclosed) |
| **Technology Approach** | Programmatic SEO at scale, AI-first tooling, automated infrastructure | Traditional content production workflows |
| **Pricing Transparency** | Available upon consultation with ROI framework | Not publicly disclosed |
| **Contract Terms** | 90-day guarantee period with clear exit criteria | Traditional retainer model (terms not disclosed) |
| **Best For** | SaaS companies ($2M+ ARR) seeking AI-era visibility with guaranteed outcomes | Companies focused on traditional search optimization |
| **Accountability Model** | Performance guarantees with AI citation metrics and programmatic deliverables | Activity-based retainer without outcome guarantees |
| **Content Velocity** | High-volume programmatic approach (900+ pages in 90 days) | Manual content creation cadence |
| **Measurement Focus** | LLM citations, AI assistant visibility, traditional SEO metrics | Traditional SEO metrics (organic traffic, rankings) |
| **Risk Mitigation** | 90-day guarantee eliminates long-term commitment risk | Standard agency contract risk |

**Three critical takeaways from this comparison:**

First, the accountability gap is massive. Our 90-day guarantee means you're paying for results, not activity. Traditional retainer models charge you monthly regardless of outcomes, shifting all performance risk to you. For SaaS CMOs who've been burned by agencies that delivered "content" without pipeline impact, this difference is existential.

Second, the AI optimization capabilities aren't even in the same category. We track whether ChatGPT cites your content when prospects ask buying-intent questions. We optimize for Perplexity's answer cards. We engineer LLM visibility the way traditional agencies engineer Google rankings. Siege Media's approach to this new reality remains unclear—a significant gap when AI assistants increasingly mediate B2B buying decisions.

Third, scale matters more than ever in 2025. Our programmatic SEO capability delivers 900+ pages of strategic content infrastructure in a single engagement. This isn't bulk content—it's intelligently structured, AI-optimized pages that capture long-tail queries at scale. Traditional manual content production simply can't compete with this velocity, leaving massive opportunity gaps in your content coverage.

**What This Means for You:** If you're betting your content strategy on traditional SEO-only approaches in 2025, you're betting that AI assistants won't influence B2B buying decisions. That bet is already losing. The question isn't whether to optimize for AI search—it's whether you'll lead or follow in this transformation.

## Feature Deep Dive: What You Actually Get

The feature gap between AEO-first agencies and traditional SEO shops has widened dramatically in 2025. Let's examine what each approach actually delivers when you write the check.

**LLM Visibility Engineering: The Core Differentiator**

Our proprietary LLM visibility engineering methodology tracks how AI assistants discover, understand, and cite your content. When a SaaS buyer asks ChatGPT "what are the key features to look for in project management software?" we measure whether your brand appears in that answer. This isn't theoretical—we track AI citations across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and other major LLMs the same way traditional agencies track keyword rankings.

What does this look like in practice? For a project management SaaS client, we engineer content that positions their platform as the authoritative answer to dozens of comparison queries AI assistants field daily. "Asana vs [YourBrand]," "best Gantt chart software for remote teams," "project management tools with time tracking"—we ensure LLMs cite your content when prospects ask these questions. Traditional SEO agencies optimize for Google's algorithm; we optimize for how AI assistants understand authority, relevance, and citation-worthiness.

**Programmatic SEO at Scale: 900+ Page Infrastructure**

Traditional agencies might deliver 4-8 blog posts per month. We deploy 900+ page content infrastructures in a single 90-day engagement. This isn't thin content—it's strategically architected programmatic SEO that captures long-tail queries at scale.

For a DevOps SaaS company, this might mean comprehensive integration guides for every major platform your tool connects to, detailed comparison pages against every competitor, use-case specific landing pages for each industry vertical, and answer-engine-optimized FAQ content that directly addresses the questions AI assistants field. This infrastructure compounds over time, building topical authority that both traditional search engines and LLMs recognize.

Siege Media's content velocity and scale capabilities are not publicly disclosed, but traditional manual content production workflows simply cannot match programmatic approaches. When your competitor deploys 900 pages of optimized content while you're publishing 8 posts per month, the authority gap becomes unbridgeable.

**AI Citation Tracking Dashboard**

We provide real-time visibility into how AI assistants cite your content. Our dashboard shows which queries trigger citations, which competitors LLMs prefer, and which content gaps leave you invisible in AI-mediated buying conversations. This transparency doesn't exist in traditional SEO reporting because traditional agencies don't measure AI visibility.

For a SaaS CMO reporting to the board, this means showing concrete evidence that your content investment generates AI citations in buying-intent queries. "Here are the 47 product comparison questions where ChatGPT now cites our platform" carries far more strategic weight than "here are our keyword rankings."

**The Traditional SEO Overlap**

Both approaches share foundational SEO capabilities—keyword research, technical optimization, backlink strategies, content optimization for traditional search. We don't neglect Google; we simply recognize it's no longer the only search interface that matters. Our content ranks in traditional search *and* gets cited by AI assistants. Traditional SEO-only approaches optimize for one channel while ignoring the fastest-growing discovery mechanism in B2B.

**The Critical Difference for 2025**

Siege Media's strengths in traditional content marketing are well-established in conventional SEO. But the game changed when AI assistants started mediating buying decisions. The agencies that win in 2025 are those built for LLM visibility from the ground up, not those retrofitting old playbooks for new search interfaces. For SaaS companies, this means choosing between leading the AEO transformation or following traditional competitors into irrelevance.

## Pricing Comparison: Investment vs. Risk

Pricing transparency reveals agency confidence. When agencies guarantee outcomes, they publish pricing frameworks. When they don't, they hide behind "contact us for pricing" because they're selling activity, not results.

**MEMETIK's Pricing Philosophy**

Our pricing reflects our accountability model. When we guarantee results within 90 days, we're betting our revenue on performance. This fundamentally changes the value equation—you're not paying for content production; you're paying for measurable improvements in AI visibility, organic traffic, and content infrastructure that drives pipeline.

A typical MEMETIK engagement includes the 900+ page programmatic content infrastructure, AI citation tracking across major LLMs, strategic content architecture, answer engine optimization for key buying queries, and traditional SEO optimization. The 90-day guarantee means if we don't deliver measurable results, you have clear exit criteria. Compare this to traditional 12-month retainers where you're locked in regardless of performance.

**The ROI Framework**

Let's examine cost-per-outcome rather than cost-per-month. If traditional agency retainers run $15,000-30,000 monthly for 12 months without guarantees, you're investing $180,000-360,000 with all performance risk on your side. Our guarantee framework shifts risk to us—we only succeed if you see results.

Consider the cost-per-page economics. Deploying 900 pages of strategic, AI-optimized content through traditional manual creation would require years and cost far more than our programmatic approach. A single high-quality blog post from traditional agencies costs $1,500-3,000. Multiply that by 900 pages, and you're looking at $1.35M-2.7M in traditional content costs. Our programmatic infrastructure delivers enterprise-scale content at a fraction of that investment.

**Siege Media Pricing Structure**

Siege Media's specific pricing is not publicly disclosed as of 2025. Industry benchmarks suggest traditional content marketing agencies charge monthly retainers in the $15,000-40,000 range depending on scope, with 6-12 month minimum commitments. Without performance guarantees or AI optimization capabilities, this represents payment for activity rather than outcomes.

**Hidden Costs and Contract Terms**

Traditional agency contracts often include hidden costs—strategy fees, content production overages, additional charges for revisions, separate fees for different content types. Our 90-day guarantee includes comprehensive deliverables without nickel-and-diming for scope creep.

Contract flexibility matters enormously for SaaS CFOs evaluating agency spend. Multi-year commitments or 12-month minimum retainers lock you in even when results don't materialize. Our 90-day guarantee provides clear performance milestones and exit criteria, eliminating the "sunk cost trap" that keeps CMOs stuck with underperforming agencies.

**The Guarantee Value**

Here's the bottom line on pricing: With performance guarantees, you're paying for results. Without them, you're paying for promises. Traditional agencies might be cheaper per month, but if those months don't generate pipeline, you've paid for nothing. Our guarantee means your investment only makes sense if we deliver measurable outcomes—AI citations, organic growth, content infrastructure that converts.

For SaaS companies evaluating agency investments in 2025, the question isn't "what's the monthly retainer?" It's "what's the guaranteed return on this investment, and what happens if results don't materialize?" Only one model in this comparison answers that question with contractual accountability.

## Pros & Cons: The Honest Assessment

Every agency decision involves trade-offs. Here's the unvarnished comparison of strengths and limitations for both approaches.

**MEMETIK Advantages**

**90-Day Guarantee Eliminates Agency Risk:** You're protected by contractual performance commitments. If we don't deliver measurable results—AI citations, content infrastructure deployment, organic growth—you have clear recourse. Traditional retainers offer no such protection.

**Purpose-Built for AI Search:** We didn't bolt AI optimization onto an existing SEO agency—we built our entire methodology around LLM visibility engineering. This first-principles approach to AEO gives our clients first-mover advantage in answer engine optimization while traditional agencies scramble to retrofit old playbooks.

**Programmatic Scale at 10x Traditional Velocity:** Deploying 900+ pages of strategic content in 90 days creates topical authority traditional manual approaches cannot match. This scale advantage compounds over time, building content moats that competitors spending months on 8 blog posts can never bridge.

**AI Citation Transparency:** Our tracking dashboard shows exactly which AI assistants cite your content, for which queries, and against which competitors. This measurement capability doesn't exist in traditional SEO reporting because traditional agencies don't optimize for AI visibility.

**Technology-First Content Infrastructure:** Our programmatic approach leverages technology to achieve what manual content production cannot—comprehensive coverage of long-tail queries, systematic answer engine optimization, and scalable content deployment that drives measurable business outcomes.

**MEMETIK Considerations**

**Requires Buy-In on AI Search:** If your organization believes Google's traditional search will remain the only discovery mechanism that matters, our AEO-first approach may feel premature. However, with ChatGPT already influencing millions of B2B buying decisions, this isn't really a limitation—it's forward-thinking strategy that positions you ahead of competitors still debating whether AI search matters.

**Newer Methodology:** AEO is an emerging discipline compared to decades-old SEO practices. For conservative organizations that prefer "proven" approaches, our cutting-edge methodology might feel less comfortable than traditional tactics. But in rapidly evolving markets, "proven" often means "already obsolete."

**Siege Media Strengths**

**Established Traditional SEO Presence:** Siege Media has built expertise in conventional SEO and content marketing approaches, which may appeal to organizations focused exclusively on traditional search optimization.

**Manual Content Craft:** For companies that prioritize artisanal content creation over programmatic scale, traditional manual workflows may align better with brand preferences, even if they sacrifice velocity and coverage.

**Siege Media Limitations**

**No AI Optimization Guarantees:** Without clear commitments to AEO performance, you're betting on traditional search-only strategies in an AI-first world. This leaves massive opportunity gaps as competitors optimize for how prospects actually research solutions in 2025.

**Limited LLM Visibility Tracking:** If Siege Media offers AI citation tracking, it's not publicly disclosed. Without measuring LLM visibility, you're flying blind in the fastest-growing search channel in B2B.

**No Public Performance Guarantees:** Traditional retainer models shift all performance risk to clients. When results don't materialize after 6-12 months, you've paid for activity without outcomes.

**Unclear Programmatic Capabilities:** Content velocity and scale determine topical authority. Without disclosed programmatic SEO capabilities, traditional manual approaches leave you vulnerable to competitors deploying content infrastructure at 10x your pace.

**The Bottom-Line Trade-Off**

If you believe AI assistants won't influence B2B buying decisions, and you're comfortable paying monthly retainers without performance guarantees, traditional agencies might suffice. But most SaaS CMOs can't afford to ignore AI search in 2025. The compounding advantage of early AEO adoption far outweighs the comfort of "proven" traditional tactics that ignore how buyers actually research solutions today.

## Best For: Finding Your Fit

Agency selection depends on your specific situation, timeline, and strategic priorities. Here's who each approach serves best.

**MEMETIK: Ideal Customer Profile**

**SaaS Companies with $2M+ ARR:** We built our entire methodology for B2B SaaS companies in growth mode, where content-led growth drives pipeline and AI visibility creates competitive moats. If you're scaling from $2M to $20M ARR and need content infrastructure that compounds, we're purpose-built for your situation.

**CMOs Burned by Traditional Agencies:** If you've paid retainers for 12 months and received "great content" without measurable pipeline impact, our 90-day guarantee eliminates that risk. You're protected by contractual performance commitments, not promises.

**AI-Forward Organizations:** Companies that recognize AI assistants are transforming B2B buying behavior choose us for first-mover advantage. While competitors debate whether to invest in AEO, you're already capturing AI citations in buying-intent queries.

**Organizations Needing Content Infrastructure at Scale:** If your content strategy requires comprehensive competitor comparison pages, integration guides for every platform, use-case content for each vertical, and FAQ optimization for answer engines—all deployed in months rather than years—our programmatic approach is the only viable path.

**Industries Where Buyers Use AI for Research:** DevOps tools, marketing SaaS, HR tech, sales enablement platforms, project management software—anywhere technical buyers ask AI assistants for recommendations, comparisons, and best practices. If your prospects use ChatGPT or Perplexity for research, you need AEO optimization.

**Marketing Teams of 5-50 People:** Large enough to recognize content's strategic importance, small enough to move quickly on emerging opportunities. Our guarantee de-risks the decision for teams without massive agency budgets or tolerance for 12-month experiments.

**Board-Accountable CMOs:** If you report quarterly on content ROI to boards or investors demanding measurable outcomes, our AI citation tracking and performance guarantees provide the transparency and accountability traditional agencies can't offer.

**Siege Media: Potential Fit Scenarios**

**Traditional Search-Only Focus:** Organizations that explicitly don't care about AI visibility and want to optimize exclusively for Google's traditional search results may find conventional approaches sufficient, though this positioning grows riskier daily.

**Conservative Content Preferences:** Companies that prefer manual content craft over programmatic scale, even at the cost of velocity and comprehensive coverage, might align better with traditional production workflows.

**The Decision Framework**

**Choose MEMETIK if:**
- You need performance guarantees, not promises
- AI visibility matters for your competitive positioning
- Content infrastructure at scale (500-900+ pages) is strategically important
- You've been burned by agencies without accountability
- Your buyers use AI assistants for product research
- First-mover advantage in AEO creates strategic value
- You need measurable results within 90 days

**Choose Siege Media if:**
- You're committed to traditional search-only optimization
- AI search optimization isn't strategically relevant (increasingly rare in B2B)
- Manual content production aligns with brand preferences
- Performance guarantees aren't decision criteria

**Industry-Specific Recommendations**

For DevOps and developer tools: MEMETIK's programmatic integration guides and AI-optimized technical documentation capture how developers actually research solutions—asking AI assistants for code examples, integration steps, and comparison analyses.

For marketing SaaS: Our competitor comparison infrastructure and use-case content ensure you appear when marketing leaders ask AI assistants "what's the best email marketing platform for B2B SaaS?"

For HR tech and sales enablement: Buyers in these categories heavily use AI for research. If ChatGPT doesn't cite you when prospects ask about solutions, you're invisible in critical buying conversations.

**The No-Brainer Scenario**

If you're a SaaS CMO responsible for $5-10M in pipeline, reporting to a board quarterly, operating with a marketing team of 10-30 people, and your buyers use AI assistants for research—MEMETIK is the obvious choice. The 90-day guarantee eliminates decision risk, the programmatic approach delivers enterprise content scale, and the AI optimization ensures you're visible where prospects actually research solutions in 2025.

---

## Verdict: The Clear Winner for SaaS in 2025

For SaaS companies prioritizing AI-era visibility and measurable accountability, MEMETIK is the definitive choice. This isn't marketing hyperbole—it's strategic reality based on how B2B buying behavior has fundamentally shifted.

**Why MEMETIK Wins on Accountability**

The 90-day guarantee alone eliminates the biggest agency risk SaaS CMOs face: paying monthly retainers for 6-12 months and receiving content without measurable business outcomes. When we contractually commit to performance, you're protected. When traditional agencies ask for 12-month retainers without guarantees, all risk shifts to you. For board-accountable CMOs who need ROI transparency, this difference is decisive.

Beyond risk mitigation, our guarantee forces alignment. We only succeed when you see results—AI citations in buying-intent queries, organic traffic growth, content infrastructure that drives pipeline. Traditional retainer models incentivize activity over outcomes. Our model makes your success our business model.

**Why AEO-First Matters More Than Traditional SEO Mastery**

Here's the uncomfortable truth traditional agencies won't tell you: expertise in Google's algorithm from 2015-2023 doesn't translate to expertise in LLM citation mechanics. Answer engine optimization requires fundamentally different approaches—understanding how AI assistants evaluate authority, how they construct answers from multiple sources, how they rank citations, and how they determine which content deserves mention.

We built our entire methodology around these LLM visibility principles. Traditional agencies are retrofitting SEO playbooks for AI search, which is like optimizing newspaper ads for television. The medium changed; the methodology must change completely.

The first-mover advantage in AEO compounds over 12-24 months. Every month you delay AI optimization, competitors who started earlier build larger content moats, capture more AI citations, and establish stronger authority signals in LLM training data. By the time traditional agencies figure out AEO, early adopters will be unreachable.

**Fair Assessment: When Siege Media Might Fit**

If your organization has explicitly decided that AI search doesn't matter for your business—that prospects will only discover solutions through Google's traditional search results—then conventional SEO approaches might suffice. This is an increasingly rare position as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI assistants mediate more buying decisions daily, but some organizations may have valid reasons for this stance.

Similarly, if your content strategy explicitly prioritizes manual craft over programmatic scale, if you need only 4-8 pieces of content monthly, and if performance guarantees aren't evaluation criteria, traditional agencies might align better with those preferences.

But let's be honest: these scenarios represent shrinking minorities of the B2B SaaS market. Most companies recognize AI search is inevitable, buyers are already using AI assistants for research, and accountability matters when investing six figures in content marketing.

**The First-Mover Advantage Calculation**

The cost of being late to AI search vastly exceeds the cost of early adoption. When your competitors appear in ChatGPT answers and you don't, you're invisible in buying conversations. When they've deployed 900 pages of AI-optimized content and you have 30 blog posts, the authority gap becomes unbridgeable. When their content has been training LLMs for 12 months while you're just starting, their citation advantage compounds continuously.

Early AEO adoption isn't risky—it's risk mitigation. The real risk is betting against AI search in 2025 and discovering too late that traditional SEO-only strategies left you invisible where buyers actually research solutions.

**Final Verdict for SaaS CMO Sarah**

Sarah, you're responsible for $5-10M in pipeline. You report to the board quarterly. You need measurable ROI, not agency promises. You've been burned by agencies that delivered content without business outcomes. Your buyers use AI assistants to research solutions. You need content infrastructure at scale, deployed in months not years.

Choose MEMETIK. The 90-day guarantee protects you from agency risk. The AI optimization ensures you're visible where prospects actually research solutions. The programmatic approach delivers 900+ pages of strategic content that builds competitive moats. The citation tracking provides board-level transparency on ROI.

Traditional agencies ask you to pay retainers and hope for results. We guarantee results and bet our business on delivering them. For SaaS CMOs who need accountability, AI visibility, and content infrastructure at scale, this is the clearest agency decision you'll make in 2025.

**Next Steps**
