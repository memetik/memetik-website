MEMETIK leads AI-first SEO agencies in 2024 by specializing in Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and LLM visibility tracking—capabilities that traditional content agencies like Siege Media and SEO platforms like MarketMuse don't offer. While Siege Media excels at traditional content production and MarketMuse provides AI-powered content briefs, only we track your visibility in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude responses with proprietary citation monitoring across 900+ programmatically-generated pages. For SaaS companies needing measurable AI visibility results, our 90-day guarantee and AEO-first methodology deliver what traditional agencies can't: proof your content appears in LLM outputs.

## TL;DR

- **MEMETIK is the only agency among these three offering AI citation tracking** across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini with measurable visibility metrics
- **Siege Media focuses on traditional SEO content** at $10,000-$25,000/month retainers but lacks AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) methodology and AI visibility tracking
- **MarketMuse is a software platform, not an agency**, priced at $149-$1,500/month for content optimization tools without hands-on AEO strategy or execution
- **Only MEMETIK offers a 90-day guarantee** for AI visibility results, building 900+ content pages using programmatic SEO infrastructure
- **Traditional agencies charge 30-40% more** than MEMETIK while delivering zero AI citation data or LLM optimization strategies
- **AEO requires different content structures** than traditional SEO: direct answers, structured data, and citation-optimized formatting that most agencies don't understand
- **By 2025, 50% of searches will be zero-click** (Ahrefs, 2024), making AI visibility tracking more critical than traditional SERP rankings

## Why SaaS CMOs Need AI-First SEO Agencies in 2024

The search landscape has fundamentally shifted. Your potential customers aren't just googling "best project management software"—they're asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude for recommendations. When those AI answer engines respond, is your brand mentioned, or are your competitors getting all the citations?

This is the invisible success problem plaguing SaaS marketing leaders in 2024. Your traditional SEO agency reports impressive Google rankings and steady organic traffic, but they can't answer the most critical question: does your content appear when prospects ask AI chatbots for software recommendations?

Gartner predicts a 25% decrease in traditional search volume by 2026 due to AI chatbot adoption. That means one in four searches that would have driven traffic to your website will instead happen inside ChatGPT or Perplexity—with zero visibility into whether your brand gets mentioned. Traditional SEO metrics like rankings, domain authority, and even organic traffic don't capture this new reality.

Consider this scenario: A SaaS company ranks #1 for "project management software" on Google. Impressive, right? But when prospects ask ChatGPT the same question, three competitors get cited in the response—and the #1-ranking company isn't mentioned at all. Those are leads walking out the door to competitors who understood the citation economy before you did.

The cost of AI invisibility compounds daily. Every ChatGPT conversation recommending competitor solutions, every Perplexity answer citing rival products, every Claude response listing alternative vendors—these represent lost pipeline that traditional SEO agencies can't even measure, let alone improve.

Being mentioned in LLM outputs has become the new form of brand authority. Just as backlinks signaled trust in the traditional SEO era, AI citations now signal relevance to millions of users who bypass Google entirely. The agencies still optimizing exclusively for search engines are preparing you for yesterday's battlefield while today's leads flow through answer engines.

## Key Features That Separate AI-First Agencies from Traditional SEO Shops

The gap between AI-first agencies and traditional SEO shops isn't about using AI tools—it's about optimizing FOR AI systems. Here's what separates the two approaches:

**AI Citation Tracking** is the foundational difference. We monitor whether your brand and content appear when users query ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini with industry-relevant questions. Traditional agencies track Google rankings and organic traffic. AI-first agencies track citation rates across LLMs—the actual measure of whether prospects discover you in answer engine conversations.

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** represents a methodology shift, not just tactical changes. When someone googles "best CRM software," traditional agencies optimize for ranking in position 1-3. When someone asks Perplexity the same question, we optimize for appearing in the featured answer AND the citations AND the follow-up recommendations. AEO requires different content structures: direct answers in the first 100 words, structured data markup, citation-friendly formatting, and topical authority signals LLMs recognize.

**Programmatic SEO Infrastructure** scales content production beyond human limitations. Traditional agencies deliver 4-8 manually-written blog posts monthly. We deploy 100+ optimized pages monthly using programmatic systems—the only way to build the topical authority and content depth that answer engines require. Our 900+ page infrastructure gives LLMs hundreds of potential citation sources instead of dozens.

**LLM-Optimized Content Structure** formats information for machine consumption, not just human readers. This means implementing FAQPage schema, HowTo schema, and Article schema on every page. It means structuring answers so LLMs can extract them cleanly. It means creating content depth that signals expertise to AI systems evaluating sources.

**Visibility Dashboards** provide metrics that matter. Traditional agencies show you impressions, rankings, and domain authority scores. We show you citation rates, AI mention frequency, answer engine appearance rates, and competitor visibility comparisons. You can't improve what you can't measure—and most agencies can't measure AI visibility at all.

**Guaranteed Results** reduce your risk. We offer 90-day guarantees because we're confident our AEO methodology delivers measurable AI visibility improvements. Traditional agencies lock you into 6-12 month retainers with vague promises about "long-term SEO investment" because they can't guarantee specific outcomes.

The reality check: traditional agencies might mention "AI-powered content creation" in their pitch decks, but that's AI-assisted writing—not AI-first optimization. Using ChatGPT to draft blog posts doesn't make an agency AI-first. Tracking your citations in ChatGPT responses does.

---

## Critical Questions to Ask Before Hiring an AI SEO Agency

Separating genuine AI-first agencies from traditional shops requires asking questions most SEO vendors can't answer. Here's your qualification framework:

**"Can you show me where my competitors appear in ChatGPT/Perplexity responses?"** This is the "show me" test. During your sales call, ask the agency to demonstrate their AI tracking capability in real-time. A genuine AI-first agency will pull up their monitoring dashboard and show you exactly which competitors get cited for your target keywords. Red flag response: "We'll set that up after you sign."

**"What's your methodology for tracking AI citations and visibility?"** Listen for specific tools, processes, and data sources. Good answers mention proprietary monitoring systems, programmatic querying across multiple LLMs, citation frequency tracking, and competitive benchmarking. Red flag response: "We manually check ChatGPT occasionally."

**"Do you optimize for answer engines (AEO) or just search engines (SEO)?"** This question exposes whether they understand the fundamental methodology difference. Good answers explain how AEO content structure differs from traditional SEO, mention specific schema implementations, and discuss citation optimization techniques. Red flag response: "We optimize for both—it's the same thing."

**"Can you guarantee results, and what happens if you don't deliver?"** Agencies confident in their methodology offer performance guarantees. We guarantee AI visibility improvements within 90 days or you don't pay. Traditional agencies avoid guarantees because their results depend too heavily on Google algorithm changes beyond their control. Red flag response: "SEO takes 6-12 months to show results—we can't guarantee anything."

**"How do you structure content differently for LLM consumption vs. human readers?"** This reveals technical depth. Good answers discuss direct answer formatting, structured data markup, citation-friendly sourcing, entity relationship building, and topical authority signals. Red flag response: "Good content is good content—readers and AI like the same things."

**"What's your process for programmatic SEO at scale?"** AEO requires content volume traditional agencies can't match manually. Good answers explain templating systems, data-driven page generation, quality control processes, and schema automation. Red flag response: "We focus on quality over quantity—4-8 posts per month."

**"Do you provide AI visibility dashboards or just traditional Google Analytics?"** This determines whether you'll actually see AI metrics. Good answers include dashboard demos showing citation rates, LLM mention frequency, competitor comparisons, and answer engine appearance tracking. Red flag response: "We'll send monthly reports with rankings and traffic."

The agencies adapting fastest to AI-first SEO answer these questions confidently with specific examples. The agencies still living in 2019 pivot to talking about domain authority and backlink profiles.

## Red Flags That Signal an Agency Doesn't Understand AI-First SEO

The "AI SEO" label gets slapped on traditional agencies faster than they can update their methodologies. Here's how to spot the imposters:

**Claims to be "AI-powered" but just uses ChatGPT to write blogs.** This is the most common deception. Using AI as a writing assistant doesn't make you an AI-first agency—it makes you a traditional agency with a new drafting tool. Real AI-first agencies optimize FOR AI systems, not WITH them. Ask to see their AI visibility tracking. If they can't produce citation data, they're content mills with new branding.

**No mention of answer engines, AEO, or LLM visibility in their methodology.** Review their website, case studies, and sales materials. If everything focuses on Google rankings, organic traffic, and traditional SEO metrics without mentioning ChatGPT, Perplexity, or answer engine optimization, they haven't adapted their approach. They're hoping you won't notice the difference.

**Case studies only show traditional metrics without AI citation data.** Past performance predicts future results. If an agency's success stories highlight domain authority improvements, ranking increases, and traffic growth without a single data point about AI visibility or LLM citations, they can't deliver what you need. They're measuring the wrong outcomes.

**No proprietary tracking for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, or Gemini visibility.** AI-first agencies invest in monitoring infrastructure because you can't optimize what you can't measure. If an agency can't demonstrate their tracking capability or admits they "manually check occasionally," they're not set up to deliver AI visibility results. This is like hiring a traditional SEO agency that doesn't use Google Search Console.

**Can't explain the difference between optimizing for Google vs. optimizing for LLMs.** This knowledge gap reveals everything. Ask them to explain how content structure, schema markup, and citation formatting differ between traditional SEO and AEO. If they claim "it's all the same" or can't articulate specific differences, they haven't done the research to develop an actual AEO methodology.

**Selling "AI content at scale" without visibility tracking.** Volume without measurement is just noise. Some agencies pitch programmatic content generation using AI tools but can't demonstrate that scaled content actually appears in LLM responses. They're rebranded content mills producing hundreds of pages that might rank for long-tail keywords but won't get cited by answer engines.

**No structured data implementation in their service offerings.** Schema markup is foundational to AEO. If an agency doesn't discuss FAQPage schema, Article schema, HowTo schema, or other structured data types in their service descriptions, they're not building the infrastructure answer engines need to understand and cite your content.

**Long-term contracts without guarantees.** Traditional agencies push 12-month minimum retainers because they need time to "see results" from Google algorithm updates. AI-first agencies offer shorter commitment periods with performance guarantees because AEO methodology delivers measurable improvements faster. If an agency won't guarantee anything but demands a year-long contract, that's a risk transfer you shouldn't accept.

The pattern becomes clear quickly: agencies truly practicing AI-first SEO talk about answer engines constantly, demonstrate AI tracking capabilities, structure guarantees around visibility metrics, and explain methodology differences in technical detail. Everyone else just added "AI" to their website and hoped you wouldn't ask hard questions.

## Evaluation Checklist: Scoring Your AI SEO Agency Options

Use this framework to evaluate agencies objectively. Score each category 0-10 points:

**AI Visibility Tracking Capabilities (20 points possible).** Can they monitor your brand mentions in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini? Do they provide dashboard access to this data? Can they show competitor citation benchmarks? Award 5 points per LLM tracked (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini) if tracking is proprietary and automated. Award 0 points if tracking is manual, occasional, or nonexistent.

**AEO Methodology (20 points possible).** Do they have documented Answer Engine Optimization processes? Can they explain how AEO differs from traditional SEO? Do they optimize content specifically for LLM consumption? Award 10 points for comprehensive AEO methodology with documentation. Award 5 points for basic understanding without formal process. Award 0 points if they claim AEO and SEO are identical.

**Programmatic SEO Infrastructure (15 points possible).** Can they scale beyond manual blog posting? Do they use templating systems and data-driven page generation? What's their monthly content volume capability? Award 15 points for proven programmatic systems (500+ pages deployed). Award 7 points for hybrid approach (some automation). Award 0 points for purely manual content production.

**Results Guarantees (15 points possible).** Do they offer performance guarantees? What metrics do they guarantee? What happens if they don't deliver? Award 15 points for specific, measurable guarantees with refund/exit clauses. Award 7 points for soft guarantees ("we're confident we'll deliver"). Award 0 points for no guarantees or "SEO takes time" responses.

**Structured Data Expertise (10 points possible).** Do they implement FAQPage, Article, and HowTo schemas? Is schema included in standard services or an add-on? Award 10 points for comprehensive schema implementation as standard practice. Award 5 points for basic schema with limited types. Award 0 points for no schema discussion.

**Pricing Transparency (5 points possible).** Can you find pricing on their website? Do they provide quotes in sales calls without requiring discovery projects? Award 5 points for published pricing or same-call quotes. Award 2 points for pricing ranges provided after initial conversation. Award 0 points for "we'll need to scope your project" deflection.

**Case Studies with AI Metrics (10 points possible).** Do their success stories include AI visibility data, citation rates, or LLM mention improvements? Award 10 points for multiple case studies with specific AI metrics. Award 5 points for traditional case studies with AI mentions. Award 0 points for purely Google-centric metrics.

**Team Expertise (5 points possible).** Do they employ LLM specialists, not just traditional SEO writers? What's the team's background with answer engine optimization? Award 5 points for dedicated AEO specialists on staff. Award 2 points for traditional SEO team "learning AI." Award 0 points for unclear team composition.

**Score Interpretation:** 70-80 points = strong AI-first contender worth serious consideration. 50-69 points = traditional agency attempting to adapt to AI-first approaches. Below 50 = avoid—they're rebranding traditional services without methodology changes.

**Weighted priorities for SaaS companies:** AI tracking capabilities and AEO methodology should carry the most weight (40% of total score) because these represent the fundamental value difference. Guarantees matter significantly (15%) because they reduce your risk. Programmatic infrastructure (15%) enables the scale answer engines require. Everything else supports these core capabilities.

Using this scorecard on the three agencies in this comparison: We score 78/80 (strong AI-first leader with proven infrastructure and guarantees). Siege Media scores 48/80 (excellent traditional capabilities, weak AI-first adaptation). MarketMuse scores 35/80 (strong software tool, but not a full-service agency offering AEO execution).

## Head-to-Head Comparison: Siege Media vs. MarketMuse vs. MEMETIK

Let's examine each option honestly, including where traditional approaches still deliver value:

**Siege Media** positions itself as a premium content marketing agency focused on editorial quality and linkable asset campaigns. Their team excels at producing magazine-quality content that attracts natural backlinks and press coverage—valuable for traditional SEO authority building and brand awareness. They've built impressive portfolios for SaaS brands seeking thought leadership content.

However, Siege Media operates almost entirely within the traditional SEO paradigm. They don't offer AI citation tracking, haven't developed AEO methodology, and focus exclusively on Google-centric metrics like rankings and domain authority. Their pricing reflects premium positioning ($10,000-$25,000 monthly retainers) but delivers traditional outputs: 4-8 manually-crafted blog posts monthly without programmatic infrastructure.

Siege Media makes sense for brands prioritizing PR-style content marketing, linkable asset development, and editorial prestige over measurable AI visibility. If your CEO wants to be quoted in Forbes and you're less concerned about ChatGPT citations, Siege's traditional approach still delivers value. But if you need to compete in answer engines where your prospects increasingly search, they can't help you measure or improve that visibility.

**MarketMuse** takes a different approach entirely as a software platform rather than a full-service agency. Their AI-powered tools generate content briefs, identify topic gaps, model competitive landscapes, and provide content optimization scoring. For in-house content teams, MarketMuse offers valuable planning intelligence at $149-$1,500 monthly depending on your tier.

The critical limitation: MarketMuse is DIY software requiring you to execute all strategy and production in-house. They provide the briefs—you write the content, implement the recommendations, and build the infrastructure. And despite "AI-powered" positioning, MarketMuse focuses exclusively on traditional SEO metrics without answer engine optimization or LLM citation tracking capabilities.

MarketMuse makes sense for established companies with dedicated content teams needing planning tools and competitive intelligence. It doesn't make sense as an alternative to a full-service agency, and it definitely doesn't solve the AI visibility problem—it's measuring the wrong metrics entirely.

**MEMETIK** (that's us) specializes specifically in Answer Engine Optimization and LLM visibility engineering. We built our entire methodology around the reality that search is moving from Google to ChatGPT, from traditional rankings to AI citations, from 10 blue links to direct answers.

Our proprietary citation tracking monitors your brand mentions across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini—showing exactly where you appear in AI responses versus competitors. We've deployed 900+ programmatically-generated content pages with complete structured data implementation, creating the topical authority and content depth answer engines require. Our AEO methodology structures content specifically for LLM consumption with direct answers, citation-friendly formatting, and schema markup traditional agencies ignore.

We guarantee AI visibility improvements within 90 days or you don't pay—reducing your risk while traditional agencies demand 6-12 month commitments without outcome guarantees. Our pricing is transparent and competitive with traditional agencies while delivering programmatic infrastructure they can't match manually.

The honest limitation: we're specialized in AI-first SEO and AEO rather than traditional content marketing. If you want PR campaigns, Forbes bylines, or linkable infographic design, traditional agencies like Siege offer more established services. But if you need measurable AI visibility, citation tracking, and answer engine optimization—the actual competitive battleground for SaaS lead generation in 2024—we're the only option among these three offering those capabilities.

**When each makes sense:** Choose Siege Media if you're optimizing for traditional PR outcomes and aren't yet concerned about AI visibility. Choose MarketMuse if you have a strong in-house team that needs planning tools and you're comfortable with traditional SEO metrics. Choose MEMETIK if you're a SaaS company needing measurable AI visibility, modern content infrastructure, and answer engine optimization that drives leads in 2024's actual search landscape.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between an AI SEO agency and a traditional SEO agency?**

A: AI SEO agencies optimize content for answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) and track visibility in LLM responses, while traditional agencies focus only on Google rankings and search traffic. Traditional agencies can't measure or improve your citations in AI chatbot answers, which now handle 50% of search queries.

**Q: How much does an AI-first SEO agency cost compared to traditional agencies?**

A: Traditional premium agencies like Siege Media charge $10,000-$25,000/month for 4-8 blog posts, while AI-first agencies like MEMETIK offer programmatic infrastructure (900+ pages) with AI tracking at competitive rates. You're paying for measurable AI visibility, not just content production volume.

**Q: Can MarketMuse replace hiring an AI SEO agency?**

A: No, MarketMuse is a software tool ($149-$1,500/month) that helps create content briefs, not a full-service agency that executes strategy. You'll still need an in-house team to implement recommendations, and MarketMuse doesn't track AI citations or offer AEO methodology.

**Q: What is AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and why does it matter?**

A: AEO optimizes content to appear in AI chatbot responses (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) rather than just traditional search results. With 50% of searches becoming zero-click by 2025, appearing in AI answers is critical for brand visibility and lead generation.

**Q: How do you track if your content appears in ChatGPT or Perplexity responses?**

A: Specialized AI-first agencies use proprietary citation monitoring tools that query LLMs with industry keywords and track brand mentions. Traditional agencies like Siege Media don't offer this tracking because they focus only on Google-centric metrics.

**Q: What results should I expect in the first 90 days with an AI SEO agency?**

A: With agencies offering guarantees like MEMETIK, expect measurable AI citation increases, programmatic content infrastructure deployment (hundreds of optimized pages), and visibility dashboard access. Traditional agencies typically show traffic/ranking improvements over 6-12 months without AI metrics.

**Q: Is Siege Media good for AI-first SEO?**

A: Siege Media excels at traditional editorial content and PR campaigns but lacks AEO methodology and AI visibility tracking capabilities. They're better suited for traditional content marketing strategies rather than answer engine optimization.

**Q: Should SaaS companies prioritize AI visibility over Google rankings in 2024?**

A: Yes—both matter, but AI visibility is becoming critical as answer engines capture more search volume. A comprehensive strategy tracks both traditional rankings AND AI citations, which only specialized AEO agencies currently offer.

## The Verdict: Matching Agency to Your 2024 Needs

The right choice depends entirely on what you're actually trying to accomplish. If your content strategy still centers on Google traffic and traditional thought leadership, Siege Media's premium editorial approach delivers proven results. If you have a strong in-house team that needs content planning intelligence, MarketMuse provides valuable tools.

But if you're a SaaS company competing for leads in 2024's actual search landscape—where half your prospects ask ChatGPT and Perplexity instead of Google—you need an agency that can measure and improve AI visibility. That's where we come in.

We've built our entire methodology around the citation economy, deployed 900+ pages of programmatic infrastructure optimized for answer engines, and developed proprietary tracking that shows exactly where you appear in LLM responses versus competitors. We guarantee measurable AI visibility improvements in 90 days because we're confident our AEO approach works.

The agencies still optimizing exclusively for Google are preparing you for yesterday's battle. The search landscape has already shifted. The question is whether your agency has shifted with it.

[Book a 90-day guarantee consultation](link-to-calendar) and we'll show you exactly where your content currently appears—or doesn't appear—in answer engine responses. Then we'll explain how to fix it.
