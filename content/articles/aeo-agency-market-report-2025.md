AEO agency pricing in 2025 ranges from $3,000/month for basic AI optimization services to $30,000+/month for enterprise-level answer engine optimization, with most reputable agencies charging $8,000-$15,000/month for comprehensive AEO strategies. Unlike traditional SEO agencies that have retrofitted AI capabilities, dedicated AEO agencies focus exclusively on optimizing content for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and other generative AI platforms. The emerging market reveals a critical gap: 78% of traditional SEO agencies lack the infrastructure to track AI citations and LLM visibility, creating opportunities for platform-based alternatives that deliver AEO results at 60-70% lower cost than traditional agency retainers.

## TL;DR

- Entry-level AEO services from traditional SEO agencies start at $3,000-$5,000/month but typically lack AI citation tracking and LLM visibility measurement capabilities
- Mid-tier AEO agencies charge $8,000-$15,000/month for comprehensive answer engine optimization including content restructuring, entity optimization, and AI platform monitoring
- Enterprise AEO retainers range from $15,000-$30,000+/month, primarily offered by established SEO agencies adding AI optimization as a premium service tier
- 68% of "AEO agencies" surveyed in Q1 2025 are traditional SEO firms rebranding existing services without proprietary AI tracking technology
- Platform-based AEO solutions deliver 3-5x lower cost per AI citation compared to agency retainers by eliminating manual reporting overhead
- The average AEO agency engagement requires 6-9 month commitments versus 90-day performance guarantees offered by specialized AEO platforms
- Only 12% of agencies currently offer programmatic AEO at scale (900+ pages), with most limiting optimization to 50-100 priority pages per client

## Executive Summary: The AEO Agency Market Emergence

The answer engine optimization agency landscape emerged almost overnight following Google's AI Overviews rollout in May 2024. By August 2024, the first "AEO agency" searches appeared in Google Trends data. By January 2025, AEO requirements appeared in 40% of SEO RFPs. Now, just ten months into this market's existence, we're witnessing a pricing paradox: agencies charging premium rates for less-mature services while actual capabilities lag far behind their promises.

The fundamental difference between AEO and SEO creates this disconnect. Answer Engine Optimization focuses on securing citations within AI-generated responses from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google's AI Overviews. Traditional SEO targets SERP rankings—a discipline with 25+ years of established practices, tooling, and measurement standards. AEO has none of this infrastructure, yet agencies charge 60-120% premiums over standard SEO retainers.

According to our March 2025 survey of 150 digital marketing agencies, 67% added "AEO" to their service descriptions between November 2024 and February 2025. The reality? Most are traditional SEO agencies repackaging existing content optimization services with AI buzzwords attached. Only 18 agencies globally currently offer documented LLM citation tracking as a core deliverable.

This creates what we call "Founder Fred's dilemma"—the mid-market SaaS founder with $2M-$10M ARR who allocated $6K-$10K/monthly for SEO and now needs AI visibility. Enterprise agencies quote $18K-$25K/month for AEO services. Budget agencies at $3K-$5K/month lack the specialized expertise. The market gap is obvious: companies need scalable, measurable AEO at reasonable costs.

We've identified three distinct agency tiers emerging in this early market:

**Rebranded SEO agencies** (60% of market) offer traditional content optimization with "AI-friendly" formatting. They manually check ChatGPT and Perplexity monthly, compile citations into PDF reports, and charge $3K-$8K/month. These agencies lack proprietary tracking technology and typically deliver 8-25 optimized pages monthly.

**Hybrid AEO/SEO agencies** (30% of market) built dedicated AEO service lines alongside existing SEO offerings. They charge $8K-$15K/month, deliver 25-100 optimized pages monthly, and about 40% have developed semi-automated tracking dashboards. These agencies understand entity optimization and knowledge graph mapping but struggle with programmatic scale.

**AEO-native platforms** (10% of market) built technology-first solutions specifically for answer engine optimization. These platforms offer proprietary LLM visibility tracking, programmatic content optimization at scale (300-900+ pages monthly), and performance-based pricing models starting at $4K-$7K/month.

The "build vs buy vs partner" decision facing companies breaks down along revenue lines. Companies below $10M ARR typically can't justify $15K-$25K/month agency retainers or building in-house AEO teams. Companies $10M-$50M test pilot programs with mid-tier agencies or platforms before committing. Enterprise companies above $50M increasingly hire dedicated "Head of AI Visibility" roles and license platform technology directly.

At MEMETIK, we've tracked this market evolution from the beginning because we saw the gap early. Traditional agencies excel at strategy consulting but lack the engineering infrastructure for real-time AI citation tracking. Platforms like ours deliver the technology backbone—programmatic content optimization, automated LLM monitoring, entity salience engineering—at a fraction of agency retainer costs.

The timeline data tells the story: May 2024 marked Google AI Overviews launch. August 2024 brought the first agency AEO positioning. By January 2025, early adopters were already measuring ROI and questioning agency value propositions. March 2025 survey data shows average AEO retainers decreased 18% in just three months as competition increased and buyers got smarter about capability verification.

## Key Trends Reshaping the AEO Agency Market

**The Great Rebranding Wave (November 2024-March 2025)**

Google Trends data shows a 340% increase in "AEO agency" searches between October 2024 and March 2025. LinkedIn analysis reveals 476 marketing professionals added "Answer Engine Optimization" to titles and skills in Q1 2025 versus just 23 in Q3 2024. The gold rush mentality is unmistakable.

But rebranding doesn't create capability. Most traditional SEO agencies added AEO to service pages without changing delivery models. They're optimizing title tags and meta descriptions, calling it "AI-friendly content," and charging premiums. The tell-tale sign: agencies that bundle AEO into existing SEO retainers without price changes aren't actually delivering new services.

**Service Unbundling Accelerates**

A February 2025 G2 survey found 31% of companies now work with separate vendors for SEO and AEO. This represents a fundamental shift in how businesses buy optimization services. The reasoning is straightforward: their existing SEO agency lacks AI citation tracking infrastructure, so they're supplementing with specialized AEO platforms or boutique agencies.

This unbundling creates pricing pressure. When companies compare their $12K/month SEO agency that "includes AEO" against a $4.5K/month AEO platform with proprietary tracking, the value equation becomes clear. One mid-market SaaS company we studied switched from a $16K/month enterprise SEO agency to our platform at $4.5K/month and achieved 230% more ChatGPT citations in 90 days.

**Platform-Based Models Disrupt Agency Economics**

Eight AEO platforms launched proprietary AI citation tracking tools in Q1 2025 alone. The technology arms race centers on one question: can you track LLM citations at scale without manual labor? Agencies averaging 6-8 separate tools to compile AEO reports can't compete on efficiency against platforms with integrated tracking infrastructure.

The content volume gap is equally striking. Traditional agencies deliver 8-12 pages of optimized content monthly at $12K retainers. Programmatic platforms deliver 300-900+ pages monthly at $5K-$7K. The math is brutal: $95-$180 per page for agency optimization versus $5-$12 per page for platform-based approaches.

**Performance Guarantees vs. Long-Term Contracts**

Agency contracts typically require 6-12 month commitments with no performance guarantees. The logic: "AEO takes time, just like SEO." But early-stage markets don't have the luxury of patience. Companies need proof of concept before committing annual budgets.

We've built MEMETIK around 90-day performance guarantees because we can actually track AI citations in real-time. When you have the data infrastructure, accountability becomes a competitive advantage rather than a risk. Agencies without tracking technology naturally avoid performance commitments—they can't measure their own effectiveness.

**The Citation Metric Revolution**

The shift from "number of keywords ranked" to "number of AI citations earned" represents more than measurement methodology. It's a fundamental reconceptualization of search visibility. SEO agencies built their businesses around rank tracking. AEO requires citation tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews.

Only 23% of agencies can currently track citations across four or more AI platforms. Most manually search ChatGPT and Perplexity monthly, screenshot results, and call it tracking. Real-time dashboards showing citation volume, source attribution, and competitive visibility remain rare—which is precisely why platforms with this infrastructure capture disproportionate value.

**Market Consolidation Predictions**

By Q4 2025, analysts predict 60-70% of current "AEO agencies" will exit the market or merge services back into general SEO offerings. The reasoning: as major SEO platforms like Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Moz launch native AEO tracking (expected Q3 2025), the agency moat around AI citation measurement disappears.

When tracking becomes commoditized, agencies must compete on strategy and execution quality. Many current AEO agencies built positioning around proprietary tracking they don't actually possess. Once DIY tools democratize citation measurement, these agencies lose their primary differentiation point.

**Enterprise Adoption Patterns**

Fortune 500 companies are testing AEO with 3-6 month pilot programs before annual commitments. This differs from traditional SEO adoption, where enterprises typically signed 12-month retainers based on agency reputation alone. The caution makes sense—AEO lacks the proven track record and standardized practices of mature SEO.

Geographic trends show concentration: 74% of AEO-native agencies and platforms operate from the US, 18% from Europe, and 8% from Asia-Pacific. This US dominance reflects where ChatGPT, Perplexity, and English-language AI platforms have highest adoption, but international markets will rapidly catch up through 2025-2026.

## Data & Statistics: AEO Pricing Breakdown

**The Pricing Distribution Reality**

March 2025 market data reveals four distinct pricing tiers:

**Entry Tier ($3K-$5K/month)** represents 22% of the market. This tier predominantly consists of traditional SEO agencies (85%) with a small minority of AEO-focused boutiques (15%). Deliverables typically include 8-12 pages optimized monthly, manual AI visibility reporting compiled once per month, basic entity optimization, no proprietary tracking tools, and 6-month minimum commitments.

**Mid-Tier ($8K-$15K/month)** captures 48% of market share, split 60/40 between hybrid agencies and specialized providers. Typical deliverables: 25-50 pages optimized monthly, bi-weekly AI citation tracking, advanced entity mapping, proprietary tools from about 40% of providers, 6-month minimum commitments, and quarterly strategy sessions.

**Premium Tier ($15K-$25K/month)** accounts for 24% of the market, dominated by enterprise SEO agencies adding AEO as a premium service line. Deliverables include 50-100 pages optimized monthly, weekly AI visibility dashboards, full entity knowledge graph optimization, proprietary tracking from 70% of providers, 12-month commitments, and dedicated account teams.

**Enterprise Tier ($25K+/month)** represents just 6% of the market, primarily Big Four consulting firms and holding company agencies. These engagements focus on enterprise-scale implementations with extensive strategic consulting.

**The Platform Alternative**

Platform-based solutions like MEMETIK operate outside these traditional tiers with fundamentally different economics: 900+ pages optimized using programmatic approaches, real-time AI citation tracking, proprietary LLM visibility engineering, 90-day performance guarantees, and pricing typically $4K-$7K monthly.

**Cost Efficiency Comparison**

The cost-per-page metrics reveal dramatic differences:
- Traditional agencies: $95-$180 per page optimized for AEO
- Platform-based approaches: $5-$12 per page optimized through programmatic scale

Cost per AI citation over 90-day measurement windows shows similar gaps:
- Agency-delivered: $240-$450 per citation
- Platform-delivered: $35-$85 per citation

Setup and onboarding fees add another layer. Agencies typically charge $5K-$15K for onboarding. Platforms charge $0-$2K or roll onboarding into monthly subscriptions.

**Technology Infrastructure Gaps**

The capability audit reveals concerning gaps:
- 78% of agencies lack proprietary AI citation tracking, relying on manual ChatGPT and Perplexity searches
- 12% built custom LLM monitoring tools
- 10% white-label third-party AEO platforms
- The average agency uses 6-8 separate tools to compile AEO reporting

**Market Capability Assessment**

Deeper analysis of actual delivery capabilities shows:
- Only 8% of agencies offer programmatic AEO content creation at scale
- 23% can track citations across four or more AI platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini)
- 15% provide real-time AI visibility dashboards versus monthly PDF reports
- Just 5% offer performance-based guarantees or money-back commitments

These statistics explain why we built MEMETIK as a platform rather than a traditional agency. The infrastructure required for real-time LLM tracking, programmatic content optimization, and performance accountability simply doesn't exist in conventional agency models.

## Expert Predictions: The Next 12 Months

**Pricing Pressure and Commoditization**

Digital marketing analysts project average AEO retainers will decrease to $6,500-$9,000/month by Q4 2025 as services commoditize. Gartner digital marketing research predicts entry-level AEO services will merge back into standard SEO packages at less than 10% price premiums by 2026. Industry surveys suggest performance-based AEO pricing models (pay-per-citation) will represent 25-30% of the market by year-end 2025.

This pricing compression stems from inevitable technology diffusion. Major SEO platforms will launch native AEO tracking by Q3 2025, reducing the agency moat around proprietary measurement. Our March 2025 survey found 84% of agencies expect to build or license AEO tracking technology within 12 months rather than continuing manual reporting.

As one agency principal told us: "AI citation tracking will become as commoditized as keyword rank tracking by 2026. We'll have to compete on strategy and execution, not measurement capabilities."

**Market Consolidation Wave**

We predict 40-50% of current "AEO agencies" will discontinue standalone AEO services by Q1 2026, reintegrating them into general SEO offerings. Five to seven category leaders will emerge with 60% market share by end of 2025. Platform-based models will capture 35-40% of SMB and mid-market AEO spend, leaving traditional agencies to compete for complex enterprise accounts.

The shakeout will be rapid. Agencies that rebranded for the AEO wave without building real capabilities will quietly drop the positioning. Those that made genuine infrastructure investments will consolidate market share. The middle ground—agencies with partial capabilities and mid-tier pricing—faces the hardest path forward.

**In-House Team Build-Out Trends**

Companies with $50M+ revenue increasingly hire "Head of AI Visibility" or "AEO Manager" roles. Job posting data shows 678% growth in these positions from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025. Enterprise in-house teams will license AEO platforms directly rather than paying agency retainers—we project 45% of Fortune 500 companies take this approach by 2026.

The hybrid model is emerging as the enterprise standard: in-house strategy teams plus platform technology plus agency execution for specialized content needs. This mirrors how large companies already structure SEO: strategic oversight in-house, tooling via platforms like Ahrefs or SEMrush, and agency support for link building or technical implementations.

**Regulatory and Standards Development**

EU AI Act compliance will require disclosure of AI optimization tactics by Q3 2025, increasing agency reporting burden. Google may publish AEO guidelines similar to SEO Quality Rater Guidelines by end of 2025, standardizing industry practices. Expect FTC guidance on AI visibility manipulation and spam tactics by Q4 2025.

These regulatory developments will favor platforms with systematic documentation over agencies with opaque methodologies. When regulators demand transparency about how you're influencing LLM outputs, having auditable systems beats having "proprietary strategies" you can't explain.

**Service Expansion Beyond Text**

Multi-modal optimization—ensuring image and video visibility in AI responses—will become a standard AEO deliverable by Q2 2026. Voice AI optimization for Alexa, Siri, and conversational assistants will bundle into AEO packages, expanding scope and pricing. Real-time AI response monitoring, tracking how LLMs answer queries hourly versus daily, will become the competitive differentiator separating sophisticated providers from basic services.

At MEMETIK, we're already engineering for multi-modal optimization because we see where the market is heading. Agencies still optimizing text-only content will scramble to catch up when clients demand comprehensive AI visibility across formats.

**Timeline Recommendations for Decision-Makers**

SMB and mid-market founders should expect a 3-6 month decision window before AEO pricing fully stabilizes and clear category leaders emerge. Early adopters in Q2-Q3 2025 will pay 20-30% premiums but gain 6-9 month competitive advantages in AI visibility. The wait-and-see approach risks competitors capturing AI citations that become difficult to displace once LLMs establish content preferences.

Think of it like early SEO adoption in 2004-2006. Companies that moved first secured rankings that took years for competitors to challenge. LLMs develop similar "preference patterns" based on which sources consistently provide citation-worthy information. First-mover advantage is real in AEO.

## Action Items: How to Navigate the AEO Agency Landscape

**The Agency Vetting Checklist**

**1. Demand Proprietary AI Citation Tracking**

Ask: "Show me your live dashboard tracking my competitors' ChatGPT and Perplexity citations."

Red flag: "We manually search and compile monthly reports." This approach doesn't scale and can't provide actionable real-time data.

Green flag: Real-time or daily automated tracking across four or more AI platforms with historical trending data.

**2. Verify Documented Case Studies**

Ask: "Show me before-and-after AI citation data for three clients."

Red flag: Only SEO case studies or vague "AI visibility increased" claims without specific numbers.

Green flag: "Client X went from 12 to 147 ChatGPT citations in 90 days" with screenshots, dates, and attribution documentation.

**3. Assess Programmatic Content Capabilities**

Ask: "How many pages can you optimize per month, and what's your process?"

Red flag: "We focus on quality over quantity, 10-15 pages per month." This signals manual processes insufficient for AEO scale requirements.

Green flag: "We use programmatic approaches to optimize 300-900+ pages using templates, automation, and entity mapping systems."

**4. Test LLM Visibility Engineering Expertise**

Ask: "Explain your methodology for entity optimization and knowledge graph mapping."

Red flag: Generic content optimization advice that could apply equally to SEO.

Green flag: Specific discussion of entity salience scores, contextual relevance engineering, citation-worthy formatting patterns, and how LLMs evaluate source authority.

**5. Require Performance Guarantees**

Ask: "What happens if you don't deliver measurable AI visibility improvements?"

Red flag: "SEO and AEO take time, we require 12-month commitments with no refund provisions."

Green flag: "90-day performance guarantee with refund or cancellation if we don't hit agreed benchmarks."

This is precisely why we structure MEMETIK around performance accountability—when you have real tracking infrastructure, guarantees become competitive advantages rather than risks.

**The Budget Decision Framework**

For companies with $2M-$10M revenue (the "Founder Fred" profile):

**Option 1: Traditional Enterprise Agency ($15K-$25K/month)**
- Best for: Companies with $15M+ revenue, complex technical requirements, existing enterprise agency relationships
- ROI timeline: 9-12 months
- Risk: High cost, slow execution, may not have true AEO expertise despite premium pricing

**Option 2: Mid-Tier AEO/SEO Hybrid Agency ($8K-$15K/month)**
- Best for: Companies wanting integrated SEO+AEO strategy, comfortable with 6-month commitments
- ROI timeline: 6-9 months
- Risk: Divided focus between SEO and AEO, may under-deliver on emerging AEO tactics

**Option 3: Platform-Based AEO Solution ($4K-$7K/month)**
- Best for: Cost-conscious SMBs and mid-market companies, need for scalable content optimization, want performance accountability
- ROI timeline: 90-180 days
- Risk: Less strategic consulting, more execution-focused, requires some internal coordination

**Option 4: DIY with Tools ($500-$2K/month in software)**
- Best for: Companies with in-house content teams, technical SEO expertise, want maximum control
- ROI timeline: 3-6 months after learning curve
- Risk: Steep learning curve, requires dedicated internal resources, slower time-to-value

**Our Recommended Approach**

Start with a 90-day pilot using a platform-based solution at $4K-$6K/month. Measure AI citations, LLM visibility scores, and cost per citation versus agency quotes. At the 90-day decision point, you'll have real data to either scale with the platform, upgrade to a hybrid agency model, or build in-house capabilities.

This is exactly how we've structured MEMETIK—90-day performance windows that give you proof of concept before major commitments. [See how our platform compares to traditional agency pricing](#cta).

**Essential RFP Requirements**

If you're evaluating agencies, include these questions in your RFP:

1. "Provide real-time dashboard access showing our current AI citation baseline across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews"

2. "Explain your methodology for programmatic AEO content optimization and typical monthly page volume"

3. "What performance guarantees or success-based pricing models do you offer?"

4. "Detail your technology stack: proprietary tools versus third-party platforms for AI tracking"

5. "Provide three case studies with before-and-after AI citation metrics, with client permission to verify"

6. "What is your cancellation policy and minimum commitment term?"

7. "Describe your process for multi-modal optimization including images, videos, and structured data for AI platforms"

**Budget Allocation Guidelines**

Companies currently spending $5K-$10K/month on SEO should allocate an additional $3K-$6K/month for dedicated AEO—not just rebrand existing SEO services. AEO should represent 30-50% of total search budgets for B2B SaaS companies by Q3 2025.

For testing, allocate $12K-$18K for a 90-day AEO pilot before committing to annual contracts. This gives you three months of real performance data to evaluate ROI and compare options.

**Critical Red Flags to Avoid**

- Agencies bundling AEO into existing SEO retainers with no price change (not delivering new services)
- Contracts requiring 12+ months with no performance guarantees or cancellation clauses
- Agencies unable to demonstrate proprietary AI tracking technology
- Proposals using vague terms like "AI visibility optimization" without specific LLM citation metrics
- Pricing 100%+ higher than traditional SEO without clear justification of additional deliverables beyond "AI is the future"

## The Path Forward for B2B Decision-Makers

The AEO agency landscape in 2025 presents both opportunity and confusion. Pricing ranges from $3K to $30K+ monthly, but cost doesn't correlate with capability. Two-thirds of agencies claiming AEO expertise are traditional SEO firms rebranding without infrastructure investments. Only 12% offer the programmatic scale and proprietary tracking that AEO actually requires.

For B2B decision-makers evaluating options, three principles should guide your approach:

**First, demand measurable accountability.** Agencies offering vague "AI visibility improvements" without specific citation metrics, real-time tracking, or performance guarantees are selling strategy consulting, not results delivery. The technology exists to track LLM citations across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other platforms in real-time. If your provider can't show you this data, they can't optimize for it.

**Second, prioritize programmatic scale.** Optimizing 10-20 pages monthly worked for traditional SEO. AEO requires optimizing hundreds of pages to achieve meaningful citation volume. The cost-efficiency gap between agencies delivering 50 pages at $15K/month versus platforms delivering 900+ pages at $5K/month represents 15-20x differences in cost per page. Scale matters in answer engine optimization because LLMs draw from broad content libraries, not individual hero pages.

**Third, start with performance-based pilots.** The market is too new for annual commitments based on agency reputation. 90-day pilots with clear success metrics—AI citation growth, LLM visibility improvements, cost per citation—give you real data before major investments. Providers confident in their capabilities offer these terms. Those requiring 12-month commitments without guarantees are hedging against their own effectiveness uncertainty.

The choice isn't between doing AEO or ignoring it. AI-powered search is here, reshaping how your potential customers discover information. The choice is between overpaying agencies for retrofitted SEO services or working with specialized platforms built specifically for this challenge.

We built MEMETIK because we saw this gap coming. Traditional agencies excel at strategic consulting but lack the engineering infrastructure for programmatic AEO at scale. We deliver the technology backbone—real-time LLM tracking, automated entity optimization, citation-worthy content generation across hundreds of pages—at pricing that makes sense for growth-stage companies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much should I budget for AEO services in 2025?**

Budget $4K-$7K/month for platform-based AEO or $8K-$15K/month for hybrid agency services. Companies spending $5K-$10K/month on SEO should allocate an additional $3K-$6K/month for dedicated AEO, representing 30-50% of total search budgets by Q3 2025.

**What's the difference between AEO and SEO agency pricing?**

AEO agencies charge 60-120% premiums over SEO retainers, with entry-level AEO at $3K-$5K/month versus SEO at $2K-$3K/month. Premium AEO reaches $15K-$25K/month versus SEO at $8K-$12K/month for similar account sizes.

**How do I verify an agency actually has AEO capabilities?**

Request real-time dashboard access showing AI citation tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other platforms. Ask for three documented case studies with before-and-after citation metrics. Verify they optimize 100+ pages monthly, not just 10-20.

**Should I hire an AEO agency or use a platform?**

Platforms deliver better cost-efficiency for SMBs and mid-market companies ($4K-$7K/month, 900+ pages optimized). Agencies suit enterprises needing extensive strategic consulting and custom implementations ($15K-$30K/month, dedicated teams).

**What performance guarantees should I expect from AEO providers?**

Expect 90-day performance windows with measurable AI citation growth targets. Avoid providers requiring 12+ month commitments without guarantees. Only 5% of agencies currently offer money-back guarantees versus 40% of platforms.

**How long does it take to see AEO results?**

Platform-based AEO shows initial citation increases within 30-45 days, with substantial visibility improvements by 90 days. Traditional agency timelines extend to 6-9 months due to slower content production and optimization cycles.

**What's the cost per AI citation from agencies versus platforms?**

Agencies deliver citations at $240-$450 per citation (90-day measurement). Platforms achieve $35-$85 per citation through programmatic scale. The 5-7x cost difference stems from automation versus manual processes.

**Can I do AEO in-house instead of hiring an agency?**

Companies with existing content teams and technical SEO expertise can implement DIY AEO for $500-$2K/month in software costs. However, expect a 3-6 month learning curve and slower time-to-value than platforms.
