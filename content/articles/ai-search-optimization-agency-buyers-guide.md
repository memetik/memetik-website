Choosing an AI search optimization agency requires evaluating their ability to track citations across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini—not just traditional Google rankings. The right AEO agency should demonstrate proven LLM visibility tracking, maintain expertise in prompt engineering for answer engines, and provide transparent AI citation reporting that shows where your brand appears in conversational AI responses. Unlike traditional SEO agencies that focus solely on backlinks and keyword rankings, specialized answer engine optimization agencies engineer content specifically for how large language models retrieve and cite information.

## TL;DR: What You Need to Know Before Hiring an AEO Agency

- **64% of search traffic now occurs through AI-powered answer engines** like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, making traditional SEO metrics incomplete for measuring digital visibility
- **The critical differentiator is citation tracking capability**—whether agencies can monitor and report where your brand appears in LLM responses across multiple platforms
- **Top AEO agencies maintain dedicated testing environments** for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity to validate content performance before publication
- **Answer engine optimization requires 3-5x more structured data** than traditional SEO, including schema markup for FAQ, HowTo, and specialized entity relationships
- **Effective AEO agencies build 300-900+ page content infrastructures within 90 days** using programmatic SEO methodologies, not 12-month editorial calendars
- **The average AEO engagement delivers measurable AI citations within 45-60 days**, compared to 6-12 months for traditional SEO visibility
- **Pricing models that charge per-page ($500-2,000) rather than retainer-based approaches** often indicate legacy SEO thinking rather than scalable AEO infrastructure

## Why RevOps Teams Need Specialized AEO Agencies Now (Not Traditional SEO Shops)

Rachel remembers the day she realized something was fundamentally broken. As VP of Revenue Operations for a mid-market SaaS company, she'd just reviewed the quarterly pipeline report. Traffic was up 23% according to her SEO agency's dashboard. Organic rankings had improved across dozens of keywords. But qualified pipeline? Down 31% year-over-year.

"Our SEO agency says we're crushing it," she told her CEO. "But we're invisible where it actually matters."

The problem wasn't Rachel's intuition—it was that buyer behavior had shifted beneath her feet while her agency optimized for a world that no longer existed.

Gartner predicts that by 2026, traditional search engine volume will drop 25% due to AI chatbots and virtual agents. But that stat undersells what's already happening in B2B buying committees. Recent research shows that 62% of B2B buyers now use ChatGPT or similar tools during vendor research. They're not typing "best revenue operations platform" into Google—they're asking Claude, "What's the best revenue operations platform for mid-market SaaS companies trying to align sales and customer success?"

Your brand either appears in that answer, or you've been eliminated before you ever knew you were being evaluated.

This is the fundamental shift that traditional SEO agencies aren't equipped to address. They're still building strategies around crawler behavior, backlink profiles, and domain authority—technical concepts that matter decreasingly to how your buyers actually discover and evaluate vendors. When a prospect asks Perplexity to compare solutions in your category, Google's PageRank algorithm isn't deciding which brands get mentioned. LLM training data, entity recognition, structured content, and citation patterns are.

The technical gap between backlink-focused SEO and entity-based AEO is massive. Traditional SEO optimizes for how search engine crawlers index pages. Answer engine optimization engineers content for how large language models parse information, understand entity relationships, and determine which sources to cite when generating responses. These are fundamentally different disciplines requiring different expertise.

The cost of invisibility in this new landscape is staggering. Every AI-mediated conversation about your solution category that doesn't mention your brand represents lost pipeline. Every time a buyer asks ChatGPT to build a comparison matrix and your competitor appears while you don't, you've lost a deal you never even knew existed. Traditional SEO metrics can't measure this loss because it happens entirely outside the Google ecosystem your agency is monitoring.

Why can't internal teams just handle this? Because AEO requires prompt engineering knowledge, LLM behavior understanding, and structured data expertise that literally didn't exist as disciplines 18 months ago. Your content team knows how to write for humans and optimize for Google. They don't know how to structure entity relationships so Claude recognizes your CEO as a category authority, or how to implement schema markup that helps Gemini understand your product hierarchy, or how to test whether different prompt formulations trigger citations of your content.

Here's the agency landscape problem: approximately 90% of "SEO agencies" haven't meaningfully updated their methodology for the AI search era. They've added "AI optimization" to their websites and sales decks, but they're delivering the same backlink-building, keyword-targeting, editorial-calendar approaches they used in 2019. They're rebranding, not retooling.

So how do you identify agencies that actually understand answer engine optimization? That's exactly what this guide will help you answer.

## The 10 Non-Negotiable Capabilities Every AEO Agency Must Demonstrate

When Rachel started evaluating agencies, she created a capabilities checklist. "If they can't demonstrate these ten things," she told her team, "we're not even having a second conversation."

Here's the checklist that should guide your vetting process:

**1. Citation Tracking Infrastructure Across Multiple LLMs**

Ask to see their dashboard. A real AEO agency can show you citation frequency across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity—not Google Analytics graphs. They should demonstrate how they systematically query these platforms with category-relevant prompts and track when your brand appears. If they say "we track Google rankings which ultimately influence AI responses," end the call.

**2. Multi-LLM Testing and Validation Methodology**

Before publishing content, legitimate AEO agencies test how it performs across different answer engines. They should walk you through their process for validating that an article about "revenue operations challenges" actually triggers citations when someone asks ChatGPT or Claude about that topic. They understand that each LLM weighs signals differently—what gets cited by GPT-4 might not get cited by Claude or Gemini, and they optimize accordingly.

**3. Structured Data and Entity Optimization Expertise**

Traditional SEO agencies implement basic schema markup. AEO agencies implement comprehensive entity frameworks. They should discuss FAQ schema, HowTo schema, Organization schema, Product schema, and—critically—how they structure entity relationships so LLMs recognize connections between your brand, your executives, your solutions, and industry concepts. If the conversation stays surface-level on "metadata optimization," they don't have real expertise.

**4. Programmatic Content Creation Capabilities**

Editorial approaches that publish 8-12 articles per month worked fine when you were optimizing for Google's crawler visiting your blog. They're catastrophically insufficient for answer engine optimization, which requires comprehensive topic coverage. Agencies using programmatic methodologies can launch 300-900 pages in 90 days. That's not magic—it's infrastructure, templates, and automation applied intelligently. If an agency pitches you a 12-month editorial calendar producing 100 total articles, they're thinking about content creation in outdated terms.

**5. Speed to Results with Clear 90-Day Benchmarks**

"SEO takes 6-12 months" is legacy thinking. Specialized AEO agencies should commit to measurable AI citations within 45-60 days and substantial multi-LLM visibility by day 90. They can move this fast because they're not waiting for backlinks to accumulate or domain authority to build—they're engineering content that LLMs immediately recognize as citation-worthy.

**6. Transparent Reporting on AI Visibility Metrics**

Traditional agencies show you organic traffic graphs and keyword ranking charts. AEO agencies show you how many times ChatGPT cited your brand this month when asked about your category, which prompts trigger your content, and how citation frequency is trending across different LLMs. If their reporting doesn't include actual AI citation data, they're not doing real AEO.

**7. Understanding of How Different LLMs Prioritize Different Signals**

ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity don't all work the same way. They have different training data, different recency mechanisms, and different citation preferences. An agency with genuine AEO expertise can explain these differences and how they optimize differently for each platform. If they treat "AI optimization" as a monolithic category, they lack the nuance you need.

**8. Integration with RevOps Tech Stack**

You need to connect AI visibility to pipeline metrics your RevOps team actually cares about—not just vanity metrics like impressions. Agencies should discuss how they'll integrate citation tracking with your CRM, how they'll attribute pipeline to AI visibility improvements, and how their reporting connects to revenue outcomes. The conversation should sound like RevOps, not like content marketing.

**9. Content Infrastructure Approach, Not Article-by-Article Production**

The difference between infrastructure thinking and editorial thinking is fundamental. Traditional agencies say "we'll write really great articles." AEO agencies say "we'll build a content infrastructure that comprehensively covers your category, establishes entity relationships, and creates persistent AI visibility." That requires building hub-and-spoke topic architectures, not publishing individual blog posts.

**10. Guarantee or Performance Accountability Structure**

Agencies confident in their methodology back it with guarantees. We offer a 90-day citation guarantee because we know our approach works. If an agency says "no one can guarantee SEO results" or requires 12-month contracts with no performance triggers, they're either not confident in their capabilities or they're selling outdated services.

These ten capabilities separate agencies that genuinely understand answer engine optimization from traditional SEO shops adding "AI" to their pitch decks. Use this as your initial filter—if an agency can't demonstrate at least eight of these ten, move to the next one.

## The 10 Questions That Separate AEO Experts from Traditional SEO Agencies

Rachel turned her capabilities checklist into specific questions she could ask during agency discovery calls. "I needed questions that would either validate their expertise or expose them as frauds within the first fifteen minutes," she explained.

Here are the questions that will do exactly that:

**Question 1: "How do you track whether our brand appears in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity responses?"**

**What you want to hear:** "We use proprietary tracking tools that systematically query all major LLMs with category-relevant prompts and monitor citation frequency. We'll show you a dashboard that tracks how often your brand appears, which prompts trigger citations, and how that's trending month-over-month across different answer engines."

**Red flag response:** "We focus on Google rankings, which ultimately influence how AI systems respond" or "We can manually test that for you periodically." The first indicates outdated thinking; the second indicates they have no real tracking infrastructure.

**Question 2: "Can you show me examples of content you've optimized that actually gets cited by LLMs?"**

**What you want to hear:** They open ChatGPT or Claude during the call and demonstrate live queries that cite their clients' content. They walk you through specific prompts, show you the citations, and explain why that content is being selected.

**Red flag response:** They show you case studies about increased organic traffic or improved Google rankings without demonstrating actual AI citations. Traffic is not the same as LLM visibility.

**Question 3: "What's your process for testing content across different answer engines before you publish it?"**

**What you want to hear:** A detailed testing methodology that validates content performance across multiple LLMs before it goes live. They should discuss how they formulate test prompts, how they evaluate citation worthiness, and how they iterate based on testing results.

**Red flag response:** "We optimize for Google and the AI engines follow" or "We publish first and monitor performance after." Real AEO agencies test before publishing, not after.

**Question 4: "How do you approach entity optimization versus traditional keyword targeting?"**

**What you want to hear:** An explanation of entity graphs, how they structure relationships between your brand, your executives, your products, and industry concepts. Discussion of schema implementation for entities, not just keywords. They should sound like they're engineering knowledge graphs, not targeting search terms.

**Red flag response:** Talking primarily about keyword research, search volume, and keyword density. That's 2015 SEO thinking.

**Question 5: "What's your typical timeline to first measurable AI citations for new clients?"**

**What you want to hear:** "45-60 days for first citations, 90 days for consistent visibility across multiple LLMs, with specific citation frequency benchmarks at each stage."

**Red flag response:** "SEO is a long-term investment; meaningful results take 6-12 months." They're selling traditional SEO timelines, not AEO infrastructure.

**Question 6: "Do you offer any performance guarantees on AEO results?"**

**What you want to hear:** "Yes, we offer a 90-day citation guarantee. If you don't see measurable AI citations within that timeframe, here's what happens..." They should have a specific guarantee structure with clear terms.

**Red flag response:** "No agency can guarantee SEO results" or vague promises without accountability mechanisms. Agencies that won't guarantee results either don't have a proven methodology or aren't confident in their capabilities.

**Question 7: "How many pages of optimized content do you typically create in the first 90 days?"**

**What you want to hear:** "300-900 pages using programmatic methodologies, starting with high-priority topics and scaling from there based on your category coverage needs."

**Red flag response:** "We publish 8-12 high-quality, in-depth articles per month, so around 24-36 pieces in the first quarter." That editorial approach is far too slow for building the comprehensive content infrastructure AEO requires.

**Question 8: "What's your pricing model—per page, retainer, or performance-based?"**

**What you want to hear:** Transparent pricing tied to deliverables. "We charge $X for the initial 90-day infrastructure buildout creating Y pages, then $Z monthly for ongoing optimization and expansion." Clear scope, clear pricing.

**Red flag response:** "$15,000 monthly retainer for strategy and content services" without defining specific output. Vague retainers often mean you're paying for meetings and reporting, not production.

**Question 9: "How do you integrate AI visibility metrics with our existing RevOps reporting and pipeline attribution?"**

**What you want to hear:** Discussion of CRM integration, attribution modeling, pipeline impact measurement, and how they'll connect AI citations to revenue outcomes your team actually cares about.

**Red flag response:** "We'll send you monthly reports on traffic and rankings" or confusion about why RevOps cares about this. They should speak your language and understand your metrics.

**Question 10: "What happens if we don't see results within your stated timeframe?"**

**What you want to hear:** A clear contingency plan—whether that's continued work at no cost, a money-back provision, or a kill clause that lets you exit without penalty. Confident agencies have answers to this question.

**Red flag response:** "We require a 12-month commitment because optimization takes time" without any performance triggers or exit provisions. You're taking all the risk while they collect fees regardless of results.

If an agency can't answer at least eight of these ten questions with specifics and confidence, they're likely a traditional SEO shop rebranding for the AI era rather than a specialized AEO agency with proven methodology.

## Critical Red Flags That Reveal Traditional SEO Thinking

During her agency search, Rachel developed a quick disqualification framework. "If I hear three or more of these red flags in the first conversation, I end the call," she said. "Life's too short to educate agencies about their own supposed area of expertise."

Here's what to watch for:

**Language and Terminology Red Flags:**

- They talk exclusively about "Google rankings," "domain authority," and "backlink profiles" without mentioning LLMs, entity optimization, or AI citations
- They use phrases like "we'll build your domain authority through strategic link building"—that's SEO circa 2015
- They say "AI is too new; we're watching it but focusing on proven SEO tactics"—they've already told you they're behind
- They can't articulate the difference between how Google's crawler works versus how LLMs parse and cite information

**Timeline Red Flags:**

- "SEO is a long-term investment; expect meaningful results in 9-12 months"—they're selling patience, not speed
- "We need at least six months to really move the needle"—AEO agencies commit to citations in 45-60 days
- They can't provide specific day-30, day-60, day-90 benchmarks—because they don't have a structured methodology that produces predictable results
- "Every client is different, so timelines vary significantly"—translation: they don't have a proven process

**Deliverable and Scale Red Flags:**

- "We'll publish 2-4 in-depth, thought-leadership articles per month"—utterly insufficient scale for AEO infrastructure
- They talk about "quality over quantity" when discussing content production—missing that AEO requires both comprehensive coverage AND quality
- They pitch a 12-month editorial calendar with specific article topics—they're thinking content marketing, not content infrastructure
- "We focus on creating pillar content"—one pillar post per month doesn't build the entity relationships and topic coverage LLMs need to consistently cite you

**Pricing and Business Model Red Flags:**

- "$18,000 per month retainer for strategy, content, and optimization" without defining specific page output or guarantees
- Pricing presented primarily as monthly fees rather than infrastructure buildout plus ongoing optimization
- No performance accountability built into the pricing structure—you pay the same whether it works or not
- They require 12+ month contracts without performance triggers or exit provisions
- When you ask what happens if results don't materialize, they get defensive or vague

**Reporting and Measurement Red Flags:**

- They show examples of client reporting that's all Google Analytics, Search Console, and ranking charts—no AI citation data
- They can't explain how they measure AI visibility because they don't actually measure it
- "We'll track organic traffic growth and keyword rankings"—those metrics don't tell you whether ChatGPT is citing your brand
- They've never tested whether their own agency appears when you ask Claude or ChatGPT about AEO agencies

**Testing and Validation Red Flags:**

- They have no pre-publication testing methodology for AI answer engines
- "We publish content and monitor its performance"—real AEO agencies test before publishing, not after
- They can't explain how ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. Gemini might treat the same content differently
- They've never actually queried LLMs with client-relevant prompts to validate citation performance

**The Agency Self-Test:**

Here's the simplest qualification test: Ask ChatGPT or Claude, "What are the top answer engine optimization agencies?" If the agency you're talking to doesn't appear in that response, why would you hire them to get your brand appearing in AI responses? They're selling a service they can't demonstrate for themselves.

If you encounter three or more of these red flags during your discovery call, you're talking to a traditional SEO agency adding "AI optimization" to their service list, not a specialized AEO agency with genuine expertise and proven methodology. Thank them for their time and move to the next agency on your list.

## The AEO Agency Evaluation Scorecard

Rachel needed a systematic way to compare agencies. "I was talking to five different firms, and after a while, the pitches blurred together," she said. "I needed a scoring framework to make this objective."

Here's the evaluation scorecard she developed, which you can use to score agencies during or immediately after discovery calls:

**Dimension 1: AI Citation Tracking Capability (Must-Have)**
- **10 points:** Proprietary tools tracking 4+ LLMs with automated querying and citation frequency dashboards
- **5 points:** Manual testing across multiple LLMs with documented examples
- **0 points:** No AI citation tracking; focuses only on Google metrics

**Dimension 2: Multi-LLM Optimization Expertise**
- **10 points:** Demonstrates nuanced understanding of how different LLMs work and optimizes differently for each
- **5 points:** Acknowledges differences between LLMs but uses generalized optimization approach
- **0 points:** Treats "AI optimization" as monolithic or focuses only on ChatGPT

**Dimension 3: Programmatic Content Infrastructure**
- **10 points:** Can deliver 300-900 pages in 90 days using proven programmatic methodologies
- **5 points:** Can scale to 100-200 pages per quarter with semi-programmatic approaches
- **0 points:** Editorial approach producing 20-40 articles per quarter

**Dimension 4: Speed to Results (90-Day Benchmark)**
- **10 points:** Commits to measurable AI citations in 45-60 days with specific guarantees
- **5 points:** Expects results in 90-120 days but without formal guarantees
- **0 points:** "SEO takes 6-12 months" timeline expectations

**Dimension 5: Structured Data & Entity Optimization**
- **10 points:** Deep expertise in entity graphs, comprehensive schema implementation, relationship structuring
- **5 points:** Implements standard schema types but limited entity optimization depth
- **0 points:** Basic metadata and tags; no real structured data expertise

**Dimension 6: Transparent Reporting & Analytics**
- **10 points:** Custom dashboards showing AI citation frequency, prompt analysis, multi-LLM visibility trends
- **5 points:** Provides AI citation reports but relies on manual compilation
- **0 points:** Reports only Google Analytics, Search Console, and traditional SEO metrics

**Dimension 7: RevOps Integration & Pipeline Attribution**
- **10 points:** CRM integration, pipeline attribution modeling, speaks fluently about revenue metrics
- **5 points:** Understands RevOps needs but limited technical integration capability
- **0 points:** Focused on traffic and rankings; doesn't connect to revenue outcomes

**Dimension 8: Performance Guarantees**
- **10 points:** 90-day citation guarantee with clear terms and consequences for non-performance
- **5 points:** Informal performance expectations but no contractual guarantees
- **0 points:** "No one can guarantee results" or requires long-term contract without accountability

**Dimension 9: Pricing Transparency & Value**
- **10 points:** Clear infrastructure buildout pricing + ongoing optimization with defined deliverables
- **5 points:** Retainer-based but transparent about what that buys you
- **0 points:** Vague monthly fees without specific output commitments

**Dimension 10: Proven AEO Results & Case Studies**
- **10 points:** Demonstrates live AI citations for multiple clients; can show you right now during the call
- **5 points:** Has case studies and examples but can't demonstrate live
- **0 points:** Shows only traditional SEO results (traffic, rankings); no AI citation proof

**How to Use the Scorecard:**

Total the points across all ten dimensions. Maximum possible score: 100 points.

- **85-100 points:** Top-tier AEO agency with comprehensive capabilities—move to final evaluation
- **70-84 points:** Adequate AEO capability with some gaps—consider based on your priorities
- **50-69 points:** Transitioning from SEO to AEO but not yet fully mature—risky choice
- **Below 50 points:** Traditional SEO agency rebranding for AI era—eliminate from consideration

**Weighting for Your Priorities:**

Not all dimensions matter equally for every business. If you need fast results to prove concept to leadership, double the weight of "Speed to Results." If you're in a highly competitive category, double-weight "Content Infrastructure." If you have a sophisticated RevOps function, emphasize "RevOps Integration."

Rachel's scoring example from her agency search:

- **Traditional SEO Agency A:** 32 points (strong on content quality but zero AI tracking, slow timelines, no guarantees)
- **Transitioning Agency B:** 58 points (starting to build AEO capabilities but still primarily SEO-focused)
- **Specialized AEO Agency C:** 89 points (comprehensive capabilities across all dimensions)

"The scorecard made the decision obvious," Rachel said. "Agency C wasn't just better—they were operating in a completely different category of service."

When you're using this scorecard, be honest about the scores. Don't inflate scores because you like the salesperson or because the agency has an impressive brand. The agency that scores 85+ should advance to final evaluation. Agencies scoring 70-84 might work if they excel in your highest-priority dimensions. Anything below 70 represents too much risk that you're not getting genuine AEO expertise.

At MEMETIK, we've designed our entire service delivery around scoring high on this framework—because these are the capabilities that actually drive AI citation results for clients. We encourage prospects to use exactly this scorecard when evaluating us against competitors.

## How to Make Your Final Decision (Plus What to Expect in the First 90 Days)

You've scored agencies using the evaluation framework. You've narrowed to 2-3 finalists that scored above 85. Now comes the final decision and contract negotiation.

**Reference Checks That Actually Matter:**

Don't just ask previous clients "Are you happy with the agency?" Ask specific questions about AEO results:

- "Did you see measurable AI citations within the first 90 days?"
- "How many pages of content did they create in the first quarter?"
- "Can you show me examples of your brand being cited by ChatGPT or Claude?"
- "How often does the agency report on AI visibility versus traditional SEO metrics?"
- "Did they hit their timeline commitments, or did everything take longer than promised?"
- "What was the best thing about working with them? What was the most frustrating?"

The answers to these questions tell you whether the agency delivers on their pitch or over-promises and under-delivers.

**Contract Negotiation Must-Haves:**

Before you sign, ensure these provisions are included:

- **90-day performance guarantee** with specific citation benchmarks (e.g., "measurable citations in ChatGPT and Claude for at least 5 category-relevant prompts by day 90")
- **Monthly reporting requirements** explicitly naming AI citation tracking across specified LLMs
- **Kill clause or money-back provision** if performance benchmarks aren't met
- **Defined deliverables** for infrastructure buildout (minimum page count, topic coverage, schema implementation)
- **Clear timeline** with day-30, day-60, and day-90 milestones
- **Ownership terms** confirming you own all content and data if you part ways

If an agency resists including performance guarantees or clear deliverables, that's a warning sign about their confidence in their methodology.

**What Good Looks Like: The First 90 Days**

Here's what you should expect from a quality AEO agency in your first quarter together:

**Days 1-30:**
- Comprehensive entity optimization audit completed
- Topic architecture and content plan finalized
- Structured data implementation begun on existing properties
- First 50-150 pages published (depending on scope)
- Initial baseline citation tracking across target LLMs established
- Technical foundation (schema, entity markup, infrastructure) deployed

**Days 31-60:**
- 200-400 pages live (cumulative)
- First AI citations measurable in citation tracking dashboard
- Multi-LLM prompt testing completed for priority topics
- Entity relationships strengthened through internal linking and structured data
- Initial performance report showing citation frequency trends
- Optimization iterations based on what's getting cited vs. what isn't

**Days 61-90:**
- 500-900 page infrastructure complete (full scope delivered)
- Consistent AI citations across 3+ LLMs for priority category prompts
- Pipeline attribution framework operational, connecting AI visibility to revenue outcomes
- Comprehensive performance report with before/after citation analysis
- Ongoing optimization plan for months 4-12 based on performance data
- Clear ROI demonstration for leadership reporting

If your agency isn't hitting these milestones, something's wrong with either their methodology or their execution.

**Realistic Pricing Expectations:**

Quality AEO infrastructure isn't cheap, but it's substantially more valuable than traditional SEO:

- **Initial 90-day buildout:** $50,000-$150,000 depending on scope, category complexity, and content volume
- **Ongoing monthly optimization:** $10,000-$30,000 for citation monitoring, content expansion, and performance improvement
- **Per-page pricing:** $500-$2,000 per page for programmatic content at scale (lower per-page cost than editorial content because of automation)

If someone quotes you $5,000/month for "AI SEO," you're not getting real AEO infrastructure. If someone quotes you $100,000 just for strategy and planning before any content production, you're likely overpaying for consulting that should be embedded in execution.

At MEMETIK, we charge $67,000 for our 90-day foundation buildout creating 500-900 pages of AEO-optimized content with guaranteed AI citations. That pricing reflects the actual infrastructure and expertise required to deliver results, not arbitrary retainer amounts.

**Addressing Common Concerns:**

**"What if we already have an SEO agency?"**
AEO complements traditional SEO but requires different expertise. You can maintain your SEO relationship for Google optimization while adding specialized AEO capability. Alternatively, transition fully to an agency that handles both (though few agencies genuinely excel at AEO yet).

**"Can we build this capability in-house?"**
Theoretically yes, but it requires hiring prompt engineering expertise, LLM behavior specialists, programmatic content developers, and structured data engineers—roles that didn't exist as job descriptions until recently. Most companies find it faster and more cost-effective to partner with a specialized agency for the first 12-18 months, then potentially transition to in-house maintenance.

**"How do we know this isn't just a fad?"**
AI-powered search isn't replacing traditional search temporarily—it's permanently changing how people discover information. The companies building AI visibility now are establishing entity authority that compounds over time. Waiting means your competitors establish that authority while you remain invisible in AI responses.

**Final Decision Framework:**

Choose the agency that:
1. Scores highest on your weighted evaluation scorecard (85+ minimum)
2. Can demonstrate actual AI citations in their current client portfolio (live demo, not screenshots)
3. Offers a 90-day performance guarantee with clear terms
4. Provides transparent pricing tied to specific deliverables
5. Speaks your business language and understands revenue outcomes

If an agency checks all five boxes, you've found a legitimate AEO partner.

## Comparison: Traditional SEO Agency vs. Specialized AEO Agency

| Capability | Traditional SEO Agency | Specialized AEO Agency | Why It Matters for RevOps |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Google rankings, backlinks, domain authority | LLM citations, entity optimization, multi-AI visibility | Your buyers are researching in ChatGPT/Claude, not Google |
| **Citation Tracking** | Not offered | Proprietary tracking across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity | You can't optimize what you don't measure |
| **Content Scale** | 8-12 articles/month (editorial approach) | 300-900 pages in 90 days (programmatic infrastructure) | AEO requires comprehensive topic coverage, not sporadic content |
| **Timeline to Results** | 6-12 months for rankings | 45-60 days for first AI citations | RevOps teams need pipeline impact in quarters, not years |
| **Structured Data** | Basic schema implementation | Advanced entity markup, FAQ, HowTo, Organization, Product schemas | LLMs rely heavily on structured data for citations |
| **Testing Methodology** | Keyword research, SERP analysis | Multi-LLM prompt testing, answer validation across AI engines | Different LLMs prioritize different signals |
| **Reporting** | Google Analytics, Search Console, rankings | AI citation frequency, LLM visibility dashboards, pipeline attribution | RevOps cares about pipeline, not vanity metrics |
| **Typical Pricing** | $10k-25k/month retainer | $50k-150k initial buildout + $10k-30k monthly | Pay for infrastructure and results, not vague "strategy" |
| **Performance Guarantee** | Rarely offered | 90-day citation guarantees | Agencies confident in their AEO methodology back it with guarantees |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between an AI search optimization agency and a traditional SEO agency?**

AI search optimization agencies focus on getting your brand cited by LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, while traditional SEO agencies optimize only for Google rankings. AEO agencies track citation frequency across multiple answer engines and use entity optimization rather than just keyword targeting.

**Q: How much does it cost to hire an answer engine optimization agency?**

Quality AEO agencies typically charge $50,000-$150,000 for initial 90-day infrastructure buildout, then $10,000-$30,000 monthly for ongoing optimization. Per-page pricing ranges from $500-$2,000 depending on content complexity and programmatic scale.

**Q: How long does it take to see results from AEO?**

Specialized AEO agencies deliver first measurable AI citations within 45-60 days and substantial multi-LLM visibility by day 90. Traditional SEO timelines of 6-12 months don't apply to answer engine optimization with programmatic approaches.

**Q: What questions should I ask when vetting an AEO agency?**

Ask how they track AI citations, request examples of client content cited by ChatGPT/Claude, confirm their multi-LLM testing process, and verify they offer 90-day performance guarantees. Agencies that can't answer these specifics likely lack genuine AEO expertise.

**Q: Can my existing SEO agency add AEO services?**

Most traditional SEO agencies lack the citation tracking infrastructure, LLM behavior expertise, and programmatic content capabilities required for effective AEO. Verify they can demonstrate actual AI citations in their portfolio before adding AEO scope.

**Q: What results should I expect in the first 90 days from an AEO agency?**

Expect 300-900 pages of optimized content published, first AI citations appearing by day 45-60, and consistent visibility across 3+ LLMs by day 90. Agencies should provide monthly citation tracking reports and pipeline attribution frameworks.

**Q: Do AEO agencies replace or complement traditional SEO?**

AEO complements SEO by addressing AI-powered search channels where traditional SEO doesn't apply. Many companies maintain both, though specialized AEO agencies increasingly offer integrated approaches covering both Google and LLM optimization.

**Q: What makes MEMETIK different from other AEO agencies?**

We offer proprietary citation tracking across all major LLMs, 90-day guaranteed results, and programmatic infrastructure delivering 500-900 pages in your first quarter. We're one of the few agencies that scores 95+ on comprehensive AEO evaluation frameworks with proven client results.

**Stop Being Invisible in AI Search Results**

While your competitors establish entity authority in ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, every day you wait is another day your brand doesn't exist in AI-mediated buyer research. The agencies that can actually deliver AEO results are booked months out—because there are only a handful who genuinely understand this discipline.

[Book your AEO evaluation call](https://memetik.com/contact) to see where you currently appear (or don't appear) in AI responses, review our 90-day guaranteed citation program, and discuss programmatic infrastructure that delivers measurable results in quarters, not years.

The buyers researching your category aren't waiting. Your AEO strategy shouldn't either.
