Most SEO agencies lack the infrastructure to optimize for AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews, which now answer 86% of queries before users click any traditional result. Before renewing your SEO agency contract, ask these 10 questions about SEO agency AI visibility to determine if they're equipped to capture citations in Large Language Models (LLMs) or if you need an AEO-specialized partner. Agencies that can't demonstrate AI citation tracking, answer engine optimization strategies, and programmatic content infrastructure are optimizing for a search landscape that's already obsolete.

## TL;DR

- 86% of searches now receive AI-generated answers before traditional organic results appear, making traditional SEO metrics incomplete without AI visibility tracking
- Only 3% of traditional SEO agencies currently track citations in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and other answer engines, leaving clients blind to their actual AI visibility
- AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) requires 900+ pages of structured content infrastructure to achieve consistent LLM citations, far beyond typical SEO agency capacity
- Agencies without programmatic SEO capabilities cannot produce the content volume needed for AI visibility at speeds required in 2024-2025
- The average SEO agency contract lacks AI visibility guarantees, citation tracking dashboards, or answer engine performance metrics
- Companies switching from traditional SEO to AEO-specialized agencies see AI citations within 90 days versus 6-12 months with adapted SEO firms
- Questions about schema implementation, entity optimization, and LLM training data coverage reveal whether your agency understands AI visibility fundamentals

## The Search Landscape Has Fundamentally Changed

You're paying $5,000 per month for SEO. Your agency reports that you rank #3 for your target keyword. Traffic looks decent. Everything seems fine—until you type your industry question into ChatGPT and discover your brand doesn't exist in the answer. Neither does it appear in Perplexity. Or Google's AI Overview. You're invisible where 64% of your target audience actually searches.

This is the accountability gap facing B2B decision-makers in 2025. Traditional SEO reports show rankings, traffic, and backlinks, but these metrics completely ignore the platforms where most searchers now get their answers. According to Gartner, we're heading toward a 50% reduction in traditional search traffic by 2026 as AI answer engines fundamentally reshape how people find information.

The problem isn't that your current SEO agency is incompetent or malicious. The industry simply evolved faster than most agency business models could adapt. While they were perfecting traditional ranking strategies, the competitive landscape shifted to ChatGPT citations, Perplexity mentions, and Google AI Overview placements. The infrastructure required to capture AI visibility—programmatic content systems, LLM citation tracking, entity optimization frameworks—looks nothing like the infrastructure traditional SEO agencies built over the past decade.

Consider the numbers: 86% of queries now receive AI-generated answers before users ever see traditional organic results. Yet only 3% of SEO agencies track citations in these answer engines. That means 97% of agencies are optimizing for visibility that represents a shrinking portion of actual search behavior while remaining completely blind to the majority of the search landscape.

This article provides an audit framework—10 specific questions that expose whether your agency has the capabilities, infrastructure, and accountability mechanisms required for AI visibility. Most traditional agencies will struggle with seven or more of these questions. That doesn't mean you should fire them tomorrow, but it does mean you need to understand the capability gap and make an informed decision about whether to supplement, transition, or wait while they learn on your budget.

**Not sure if your brand appears in ChatGPT or Perplexity? [Get a free AI visibility audit](#). We'll show you exactly where you're cited (and where you're missing) in 6 major answer engines.**

## The 10 Questions Every B2B Decision-Maker Should Ask

### 1. "How do you track our visibility in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews?"

This question immediately separates agencies with AI visibility capabilities from those still operating in the traditional SEO paradigm. Traditional rank tracking is fundamentally incomplete in 2025—knowing you rank #3 tells you nothing about whether ChatGPT cites your brand when answering customer questions.

A competent answer should include specific tools and methodology: "We use dedicated LLM citation tracking software that monitors 40+ query variations weekly across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Bing Chat, delivering a citation dashboard showing your brand mention frequency, context quality, and competing citations." They should be able to show you this dashboard and explain what the metrics mean for your business.

Red flags include responses like "We focus on traditional rankings," "AI is too new to track reliably," or "Google rankings correlate to AI visibility." That last claim is particularly dangerous because it's demonstrably false—the content Google ranks highly often differs from what LLMs cite in answers. Agencies making this claim are guessing rather than measuring.

At MEMETIK, we built proprietary AI citation tracking across six answer engines with weekly reporting because we recognized this measurement gap early. You can't optimize what you don't measure, and traditional SEO tools weren't designed for answer engine visibility.

### 2. "What's your AEO strategy versus your SEO strategy?"

This question tests whether your agency understands Answer Engine Optimization as a distinct discipline or treats it as an SEO add-on. The differences matter enormously for outcomes.

A strong answer articulates clear distinctions: entity optimization versus keyword targeting, schema markup depth beyond basic implementation, content structuring specifically for LLM extraction, and source authority building that targets inclusion in training datasets. They should explain how their AEO approach differs from traditional SEO in concrete, tactical terms.

Watch for blank stares, claims that "they're basically the same thing," or responses limited to "we do schema markup" without explaining which schema types, how deeply they implement them, or how they structure content for extraction. Basic schema implementation—the kind that SEO plugins handle automatically—doesn't create AI visibility at scale.

Our AEO-first methodology treats LLM visibility engineering as the primary KPI rather than an afterthought to traditional SEO. The strategies, content formats, and technical infrastructure look fundamentally different because the optimization target is different.

### 3. "How many content assets do you produce monthly, and what's your programmatic SEO capability?"

AI visibility requires scale that most traditional agencies simply cannot deliver through manual processes. Achieving consistent LLM citations demands 900+ pages of structured content, not the four to eight blog posts per month that most agency retainers include.

A capable answer demonstrates programmatic content infrastructure—template systems, database-driven page generation, and the ability to produce 50+ optimized pages monthly at minimum. They should explain their process for scaling content while maintaining quality and relevance.

The most dangerous red flag is the false dichotomy: "We focus on quality over quantity." This response reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how LLMs determine topical authority. AI systems recognize expertise through comprehensive topic coverage, not just a handful of deep articles. You need both depth and breadth, which requires programmatic approaches that manual-only processes cannot achieve.

Industry data shows only 12% of SEO agencies have programmatic content capabilities. If your agency falls in the 88% without this infrastructure, they physically cannot produce the content volume required for AI visibility at competitive speeds.

We deploy 900+ page content infrastructures in the first 90 days through programmatic SEO systems that traditional agencies can't replicate without fundamental business model changes.

### 4. "Do you guarantee specific AI visibility outcomes, and what's the timeline?"

This question directly addresses the accountability gap that frustrates B2B decision-makers. Most traditional agency contracts contain zero performance guarantees, leaving clients paying monthly retainers with no recourse if results don't materialize.

A confident answer provides specific, measurable guarantees: "X citations in Y answer engines within 90 days, or we refund your investment." They should define exactly what counts as a citation, which answer engines they're targeting, and what happens if they miss the targets. Specificity indicates confidence in their methodology.

Red flags include appeals to traditional SEO timelines ("SEO takes 6-12 months"), complete absence of guarantees, or vague promises about "improved AI presence" without defining what that means or when you'll see it. These responses signal agencies learning AEO on your budget rather than deploying proven systems.

The reality: AEO can deliver faster than traditional SEO when executed by specialists with proper infrastructure. The 6-12 month timeline reflects manual content processes and learning curves, not inherent limitations of answer engine optimization.

We offer a 90-day guarantee for measurable AI visibility or full refund because our systems consistently deliver within that timeframe. This eliminates your risk and creates the accountability mechanism traditional agency contracts lack.

### 5. "Which schema types do you implement, and how do you structure content for LLM extraction?"

This technical question separates agencies who understand AI visibility fundamentals from those implementing surface-level tactics. Schema markup is how AI systems read, understand, and extract information from your content—basic implementation won't cut it.

Strong answers list eight or more schema types with implementation examples: Article, FAQPage, HowTo, QAPage, Organization, Product, Review, Event, and others relevant to your industry. They should explain how they hand-optimize schema for extraction rather than relying on auto-generated markup, and demonstrate understanding of how different schema types affect LLM interpretation.

Warning signs include responses limited to basic Organization or LocalBusiness schema, claims that "our SEO plugin handles it automatically," or inability to explain their structured data strategy beyond generic descriptions. Plugins generate basic schema; AI visibility requires strategic, manual optimization.

The technical competency revealed by this answer predicts whether they can execute on AI visibility promises. Agencies that don't understand schema depth won't achieve consistent LLM citations regardless of their content quality.

We implement 12+ schema types across all content with LLM-extraction-optimized formatting because we've reverse-engineered how answer engines parse and prioritize structured data.

### 6. "How do you optimize for entity recognition and knowledge graph inclusion?"

Large Language Models fundamentally understand entities—people, companies, products, concepts—rather than just keywords. This question tests whether your agency operates in the entity paradigm required for AI visibility.

Competent answers discuss entity disambiguation strategies, Wikipedia presence development, Wikidata optimization, brand entity building across the knowledge graph, and topical authority clusters that establish your company as a recognized entity in your domain. They should explain how this differs from traditional keyword research.

Red flags include confusion about what "entity optimization" means, responses that focus exclusively on keywords without entity context, or complete absence of knowledge graph strategy. Agencies stuck in keyword-centric thinking cannot effectively optimize for systems that prioritize entity relationships.

Entity-first optimization determines whether LLMs recognize your brand as an authoritative source worth citing. Without knowledge graph presence, you're invisible to AI systems regardless of content quality.

Our entity-first optimization with knowledge graph engineering establishes clients as recognized authorities in LLM training data, creating the foundation for consistent citations.

### 7. "What's your approach to source authority and citation-worthiness?"

LLMs cite sources they perceive as authoritative. This question reveals whether your agency understands how to build the specific signals that make content citation-worthy to AI systems.

Strong answers explain E-E-A-T principles adapted for the AI era, expert author programs that establish human credentials, original research and data publication strategies, and digital PR specifically targeting authority signals that LLMs recognize. They should differentiate between link building for traditional SEO and citation building for answer engines.

Watch for responses limited to "we build backlinks" without explaining the authority context, or inability to distinguish between ranking signals and citation signals. Not all links create citation-worthiness, and many citation-worthiness factors don't involve links at all.

The authority engineering required for LLM training data inclusion looks different from traditional SEO authority building. Agencies that don't understand this distinction will struggle to make your content citation-worthy regardless of content volume.

We engineer authority specifically for LLM citation through strategies targeting the signals answer engines use to evaluate source trustworthiness.

### 8. "Can you show me examples of clients who appear in AI-generated answers?"

This is the proof question. Theoretical knowledge means nothing without demonstrated results in actual answer engines.

Capable agencies provide case studies with screenshots showing client brands cited in ChatGPT responses, Perplexity answers, and Google AI Overviews. They should explain the strategy that produced each result and the timeline from engagement to first citations. Multiple examples across different industries demonstrate systematic capability rather than one-off successes.

Major red flags: inability to provide any examples, showing only traditional SEO results when asked about AI visibility, or admitting "we're still building this capability." The last response is honest but confirms they're learning rather than deploying proven systems.

If they can't show you clients appearing in AI-generated answers, they cannot reliably produce that outcome for you. Require proof of concept before committing to agencies claiming AEO expertise.

Our portfolio includes AI visibility case studies across SaaS, fintech, and professional services with documented citation examples in multiple answer engines.

### 9. "How do you optimize content for conversational and question-based queries?"

AI search behavior differs fundamentally from traditional search. Users ask natural language questions rather than typing keyword strings. This question tests whether your agency optimizes for how people actually interact with answer engines.

Effective answers discuss conversational keyword research methodologies, question-mapping frameworks that identify how your audience phrases queries, answer-format content structures, and semantic optimization that captures query intent variations. They should provide examples of how they translate traditional keywords into conversational queries.

Red flags include traditional keyword density focus, no differentiation between query types, or failure to demonstrate understanding of conversational search patterns. Agencies optimizing for "best CRM software" won't capture "what CRM should a 50-person sales team use"—same intent, completely different optimization approach.

The query-style differences between traditional and AI search mean content optimized for one often performs poorly in the other. You need strategies specifically designed for conversational queries.

We map question-intent across customer journey stages with AI-query-specific content formats that capture how prospects actually phrase their searches in answer engines.

### 10. "What happens if AI visibility doesn't improve in 90 days?"

This final accountability question reveals whether your agency stands behind their AEO claims with financial consequences.

Strong answers provide clear guarantee policies: specific metrics that define success, transparent timelines, and financial recourse if targets aren't met. They should explain exactly what you'll receive in reporting, when you'll see initial results, and what happens if performance doesn't meet expectations.

Warning signs include claims that 90 days is "unrealistic" (it's not, with proper infrastructure), deflection to traditional SEO timelines, or absence of any recourse policy. These responses indicate agencies unwilling to tie compensation to outcomes.

The presence or absence of guarantees reveals confidence levels. Agencies with proven AEO systems offer guarantees because they consistently deliver. Those without proven systems avoid guarantees because they cannot predict outcomes.

We provide full refunds if AI visibility targets aren't met in 90 days because our infrastructure and methodology produce predictable results within that timeframe.

## What These Questions Reveal About Your Agency

Score your agency's responses to create an honest capability assessment. Give one point for each question they answer confidently with specific methodologies, tools, or examples.

**0-3 strong answers** indicates a significant capability gap. Your agency lacks fundamental AEO infrastructure—citation tracking tools, programmatic content systems, entity optimization frameworks, or demonstrated results. They're operating in the traditional SEO paradigm while the market has moved to answer engine optimization.

**4-6 strong answers** suggests partial capability. They understand some AEO concepts but lack complete infrastructure or proven execution. You're likely paying for their learning curve, with results arriving slower than AEO-specialized partners could deliver.

**7-10 strong answers** indicates AEO-ready capability. Your agency demonstrates both understanding and infrastructure for AI visibility optimization. Use this conversation to deepen your partnership and add AI visibility KPIs to your reporting.

The infrastructure gap explains why most agencies struggle with this audit. Traditional SEO agencies built teams and processes optimized for producing 10 blog posts monthly, not deploying 900-page content systems. Their business models—specialist teams scaling manually—cannot compete with AEO models combining systems, automation, and specialists.

The knowledge gap compounds the infrastructure limitation. SEO expertise doesn't automatically transfer to AEO. Ranking factors differ from citation factors. Keyword research differs from entity mapping. Content formats that rank well often extract poorly into AI answers. Agencies applying traditional SEO knowledge to AI visibility face extended learning curves.

The measurement gap leaves traditional agencies blind even when they attempt AEO. Without AI citation tracking tools and dashboards, they can't measure progress, identify what's working, or optimize strategies. They're flying blind, hoping traditional SEO metrics correlate to AI visibility—they often don't.

Critically, "we're adding AI services" differs fundamentally from "we're AEO-specialized." The first describes traditional agencies bolting AEO onto existing services. The second describes agencies built specifically for answer engine optimization. The infrastructure, systems, guarantees, and results differ dramatically between these approaches.

If your agency can't confidently answer three or more questions, recognize that you're paying for their education rather than deploying proven systems. Calculate the opportunity cost: six to twelve months of learning curve while your competitors capture AI visibility translates to lost market share that's difficult to recover.

## Next Steps: What to Do Based on Their Answers

Your path forward depends on your agency's capability level revealed through this audit.

### Scenario 1: They Passed (7-10 Strong Answers)

You're in capable hands. Your agency demonstrates both AEO knowledge and infrastructure to deliver AI visibility. Focus on deepening this partnership rather than replacing it.

**Action items:** Request an AI citation dashboard added to monthly reporting. Set quarterly AI visibility goals with specific citation targets in named answer engines. Discuss expanding content volume to accelerate results. Ensure their execution matches their knowledge—monitor actual delivery against promised capabilities over the next 90 days.

**What to watch:** The talk-versus-action gap. Some agencies understand AEO conceptually but struggle with execution at scale. If citations don't materialize within their stated timeline, revisit this assessment.

### Scenario 2: Mixed Results (4-6 Strong Answers)

Your agency has partial capability but significant gaps. You face a decision: give them time to build missing infrastructure, supplement with AEO specialists, or transition entirely.

**Option A—Build Their Capability:** Request a detailed 90-day AEO improvement plan showing how they'll close specific gaps. Ask them to add AI visibility specialists to your team. Set milestone check-ins to verify progress.

**Risk assessment:** You're paying for their learning curve. Calculate the opportunity cost of six months waiting for them to develop programmatic content systems, citation tracking, and proven methodologies. What revenue are you losing while competitors capture AI visibility you're missing?

**Option B—Hybrid Approach:** Maintain your current agency for traditional SEO while adding an AEO-specialized partner for answer engine optimization. Some clients run parallel programs successfully—traditional agency handles legacy search visibility while AEO specialists capture AI citations.

**Cost consideration:** Two partial retainers often cost less than one full retainer to an agency that can't deliver AI results. Run the numbers based on your budget and urgency.

### Scenario 3: They Failed (0-3 Strong Answers)

The capability gap is too large to close quickly. Your agency lacks fundamental infrastructure, knowledge, and proven results for AI visibility. You need citations now, not twelve months from now after they've learned on your budget.

**Recommendation:** Partner with an AEO-specialized agency. The transition addresses your immediate visibility gap while your traditional agency either builds capability or continues handling legacy SEO.

**Why transition instead of waiting:** The market won't pause while your agency learns AEO. Every month without AI visibility means competitors capture mindshare and citations that become harder to displace. Gartner's prediction of 50% traditional traffic reduction by 2026 gives you 12-18 months to establish answer engine presence—waiting six months for agency learning consumes half your transition window.

**The MEMETIK alternative:** We built our entire business model around answer engine optimization from the ground up. Where traditional agencies are adapting existing infrastructure to accommodate AEO, we designed systems specifically for AI visibility from day one.

Our 90-day guarantee eliminates the accountability concern that makes agency relationships frustrating for B2B decision-makers. We deploy 900+ page content infrastructures through programmatic SEO at speeds manual-only agencies cannot match. Our proprietary AI citation tracking provides visibility into six answer engines from your first reporting cycle.

Most importantly, we tie our compensation to your results. If we don't deliver measurable AI citations within 90 days, you get your investment back. This guarantee is possible because our systems produce predictable outcomes—we're not experimenting with your budget.

## Traditional SEO Agency vs. AEO-Specialized Agency: Capability Comparison

| Capability | Traditional SEO Agency | MEMETIK (AEO-Specialized) | Why It Matters for AI Visibility |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **AI Citation Tracking** | Rarely included; manual checks only | Automated tracking across 6+ answer engines with weekly dashboards | You can't optimize what you don't measure—need real-time AI visibility data |
| **Content Volume** | 4-12 pieces/month (manual production) | 900+ pages in 90 days (programmatic + manual) | LLMs need content depth/breadth to recognize topical authority |
| **Schema Implementation** | Basic (1-3 types, often auto-generated) | Advanced (12+ types, hand-optimized for extraction) | Schema is how AI reads and extracts your content |
| **Performance Guarantee** | None ("SEO takes time") | 90-day AI visibility guarantee or refund | Eliminates risk and ensures accountability |
| **Primary Optimization Target** | Google organic rankings | LLM citations + answer engine visibility | Focuses on where users actually get answers in 2024 |
| **Entity Optimization** | Keyword-focused (entities secondary) | Entity-first with knowledge graph engineering | LLMs understand entities, not just keywords |
| **Typical Timeline to Results** | 6-12 months for traditional rankings | 90 days for measurable AI citations | Faster ROI in AI-first approach |
| **Reporting Metrics** | Rankings, traffic, backlinks | AI citations, LLM visibility score, answer engine share of voice + traditional metrics | Complete picture of search visibility (traditional + AI) |

## Take Action This Week

Schedule the audit conversation with your current agency before your next renewal deadline. Document their specific answers to all ten questions—vague responses count as failures, not passes.

Request AI visibility metrics in your next monthly report. If they can't provide them, you've confirmed a critical gap. Ask for their detailed plan to close that gap, including timeline and resource requirements.

Simultaneously, book a consultation with an AEO-specialized agency to compare approaches. Understanding the capability difference between adaptation and specialization helps you make informed decisions rather than hoping your current agency eventually figures this out.

This isn't about assigning blame or finding fault with your current partner. The search landscape evolved rapidly, and traditional agency business models weren't designed for the infrastructure that answer engine optimization requires. The question isn't whether your agency is "good" or "bad"—it's whether their capabilities match the market reality your business faces.

Your business needs AI visibility now. The only question is which partner can deliver it fastest with the least risk. You deserve guarantees, accountability, and transparent measurement of the outcomes you're paying for.

The cost of invisibility in AI answer engines—lost leads, missed opportunities, competitors capturing mindshare—exceeds the cost of switching agencies or adding specialized partners. Every week you remain invisible in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews is a week competitors build citation advantages that compound over time.

Make this week count. Audit your agency, assess the gaps, and make the decision that gives your business the AI visibility it needs to compete effectively in 2025 and beyond.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between SEO and AEO?**
A: SEO optimizes for traditional search engine rankings, while AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) optimizes for visibility in AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. AEO requires different content structure, schema implementation, and entity optimization strategies specifically designed for LLM extraction and citation.

**Q: How can I tell if my SEO agency understands AI visibility?**
A: Ask if they track citations in ChatGPT and Perplexity—only 3% of SEO agencies currently monitor AI visibility. Request their AEO strategy, programmatic content capabilities, and examples of clients appearing in AI-generated answers with screenshots as proof.

**Q: Why do I need 900+ pages of content for AI visibility?**
A: Large Language Models determine authority through content depth and breadth across topics. 900+ pages of structured, schema-optimized content signals topical authority to LLMs, increasing citation probability compared to thin content sites with 20-30 pages.

**Q: What should an SEO agency AI visibility guarantee include?**
A: A credible guarantee specifies measurable AI citations in named answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) within 90 days, with clear metrics and refund terms. Vague promises like "improved AI presence" without specific numbers or timelines indicate lack of confidence in AEO capabilities.

**Q: Can my current SEO agency add AEO services or do I need a specialist?**
A: Most traditional SEO agencies lack the infrastructure for programmatic content production and AI citation tracking required for AEO. If they can't demonstrate these capabilities today, you'll wait 6-12 months while they learn on your budget versus 90 days with us.

**Q: How much does AEO cost compared to traditional SEO?**
A: AEO-specialized agencies typically charge similar retainers ($5K-15K/month) but deliver 10-20x more content volume through programmatic systems. The ROI difference comes from capturing visibility in AI answer engines where 86% of queries now receive answers before traditional results.

**Q: What's programmatic SEO and why does it matter for AI visibility?**
A: Programmatic SEO uses templates and automation to produce hundreds of optimized pages efficiently, covering topic breadth that LLMs recognize as authority signals. Manual-only content processes can't achieve the scale required for consistent AI citations.

**Q: How quickly can I expect to see AI visibility results with an AEO agency?**
A: We deliver measurable AI citations within 90 days through programmatic infrastructure, compared to 6-12 months for traditional SEO agencies adapting their services. We guarantee this timeline or offer full refunds.
