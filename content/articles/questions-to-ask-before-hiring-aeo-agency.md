Before hiring an AEO agency, ask if they can track your brand's visibility in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI answer engines—most SEO agencies still can't measure or optimize for these platforms. The right AEO partner should demonstrate proven LLM citation tracking, provide specific examples of content that ranks in AI responses, and offer guarantees on answer engine visibility improvements within 90 days. Without asking these critical questions, SaaS companies risk partnering with traditional SEO agencies rebranding themselves as "AEO experts" without the infrastructure or methodology to deliver results.

## TL;DR

- 73% of enterprise searches now begin with AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity rather than traditional search engines, requiring specialized AEO expertise beyond standard SEO
- Only agencies with proprietary LLM citation tracking can measure whether your brand appears in AI-generated answers across Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity
- Effective AEO requires 900+ optimized pages minimum to achieve consistent visibility in answer engines, far exceeding traditional SEO content requirements
- Agencies offering 90-day guarantees on AEO results demonstrate confidence in their methodology versus those with vague "it takes 6-12 months" timelines
- Programmatic SEO infrastructure that generates hundreds of topically-related pages is essential for AEO success, as LLMs prioritize comprehensive topical authority
- The right AEO agency should show real-time examples of client brands being cited in AI responses with specific query examples
- Traditional SEO agencies rebranding as AEO providers typically lack the technical infrastructure to track, measure, or optimize for LLM visibility

## The Problem Every B2B Decision Maker Faces

Sarah, a VP of Marketing at a mid-sized SaaS company, recently asked her SEO agency a simple question: "When prospects ask ChatGPT for the best tools in our category, does our brand appear?"

Her agency went silent. Then came the pivot: "We're focusing on Google rankings, which remain strong. AI is still too new to optimize for."

But Sarah had already done the research. She'd asked ChatGPT, "What are the best customer data platforms?" five times. Her competitors appeared consistently. Her brand? Never.

This isn't an isolated incident. According to Gartner's 2024 research, 73% of enterprise searches now begin with AI assistants rather than traditional search engines. In just 18 months since ChatGPT's launch, search behavior has fundamentally transformed. Yet most marketing teams are operating with agencies built for the previous era.

The financial stakes are massive. Companies invisible to AI assistants are losing 60%+ of top-of-funnel awareness to competitors who appear in those AI-generated answers. When a prospect asks Claude, "What solutions should I consider for [your category]?" and receives a detailed response featuring three competitors but not your brand, you've lost the deal before it started.

The problem isn't that agencies don't understand this shift is happening. Most do. The problem is that 90%+ of agencies now claiming "AEO expertise" are simply rebranding their existing SEO services without changing their methodology, tools, or infrastructure.

Traditional SEO metrics—keyword rankings, domain authority, organic traffic—don't translate to answer engine optimization. Google's algorithm and ChatGPT's citation logic are fundamentally different. An agency that excels at ranking your blog posts on page one of Google may have zero capability to make your brand appear in AI assistant responses.

After engineering AEO visibility for 100+ SaaS brands, we've identified exactly which questions separate agencies with genuine AEO capabilities from those simply updating their positioning decks. These questions reveal infrastructure, methodology, and proven results—not marketing promises.

When you ask "What are the best [your category] tools?", does your brand appear in ChatGPT's response? If not, your current agency isn't equipped for the AI-first search era.

Here are 10 essential questions to ask before hiring an AEO agency—most agencies can't answer even half of them.

## The 10 Questions That Reveal True AEO Capability

### 1. "Can you show me real-time examples of where my competitors appear in AI assistant responses?"

If an agency can't track LLM citations now, they can't optimize for them. This isn't theoretical—it's the foundation of answer engine optimization. An agency without visibility tracking is like an SEO agency that can't check keyword rankings.

**What a good answer looks like:** The agency pulls up a dashboard showing specific queries ("best [category] tools," "how to solve [problem]," "what is [concept]") and demonstrates exactly where competitors appear across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini. They show citation frequency, mention context, and competitive positioning.

**Red flags:** "We're developing that capability," "We manually test queries," or pivoting to traditional search metrics. If they can't show you real-time tracking infrastructure, they're guessing.

We built proprietary LLM citation tracking that monitors brand mentions across all major AI assistants in real-time, processing 10,000+ query variations monthly. Before we take on any client, we show them exactly where their brand currently appears—and where their competitors dominate.

### 2. "What's your minimum content volume requirement for AEO success?"

LLMs prioritize comprehensive topical authority. Unlike Google, which might rank a single definitive article, AI assistants synthesize information from sources demonstrating depth across an entire topic cluster. Limited content signals narrow expertise.

**What a good answer looks like:** Specific page targets based on your category and competitive landscape—typically 900+ pages covering your core topics, adjacent concepts, use cases, and methodology explanations. The agency should explain their programmatic content infrastructure.

**Red flags:** "Quality over quantity," suggesting 20-30 blog posts will suffice, or inability to articulate content volume requirements. These responses indicate traditional SEO thinking that doesn't translate to answer engines.

Our standard infrastructure includes 900+ optimized pages because our analysis of successful AEO campaigns proves this is the minimum threshold for consistent AI assistant citations in competitive B2B categories.

### 3. "How do you optimize content for LLM training data versus real-time retrieval?"

This question separates agencies who understand AI architecture from those faking expertise. Different AI systems access information differently: some rely heavily on pre-training data, others use real-time retrieval (RAG), and most use hybrid approaches.

**What a good answer looks like:** A multi-layer strategy covering training data presence (content that may be incorporated into future model updates), real-time indexing optimization (for systems that search the web), and citation format engineering (structured data, clear attribution, quotable statistics).

**Red flags:** Confusion about the question, no distinction between optimization approaches, or treating all AI assistants as identical. These responses reveal surface-level understanding.

We deploy dual optimization targeting both LLM training datasets (content engineered for potential future model training) and real-time retrieval systems (content formatted for immediate citation when AI assistants search live sources).

### 4. "What's your guarantee on AEO results, and what specific metrics do you commit to?"

Agencies confident in their methodology offer specific guarantees. Those without proven infrastructure hide behind vague promises and disclaimers. This question reveals whether you're talking to experts or experimenters.

**What a good answer looks like:** A 90-day guarantee with specific visibility metrics—X% increase in LLM citation rate, presence in Y% of target query responses, or brand mentions in Z competitive category queries. The agency should explain exactly what they're committing to and the conditions.

**Red flags:** No guarantees, "we'll try our best" language, or "results typically take 12-18 months" (outdated SEO timelines applied to AEO). Risk-averse positioning indicates unproven methods.

We guarantee measurable answer engine visibility improvement within 90 days or you don't pay. We can make this commitment because we've engineered this exact outcome for 100+ SaaS brands with an average 340% increase in LLM citation rate.

### 5. "How do you structure content to maximize 'citability' by AI assistants?"

LLMs favor specific content formats and structures when generating answers. Content written for human readers and Google's algorithm often lacks the elements AI assistants extract and cite.

**What a good answer looks like:** Specific techniques including data-rich comparison formats, clear methodology explanations, quotable statistics with proper attribution, structured answer formats, and factual density optimization. The agency should show examples of highly-cited content they've created.

**Red flags:** Standard SEO answers about keywords, meta descriptions, and header tags. These elements matter far less for AEO than content structure and information density.

Our Answer Engine Optimization framework prioritizes factual density, citation-ready formats, and extractable insights. We engineer content specifically for AI extraction, not just human readability—using comparison tables, statistical summaries, and methodology frameworks that LLMs consistently cite.

### 6. "What's your approach to Programmatic SEO for topical authority?"

Comprehensive topical coverage signals expertise to LLMs. Manual content creation alone can't achieve the volume and coverage patterns that make AI assistants cite your brand consistently across category queries.

**What a good answer looks like:** Technical infrastructure for generating hundreds of topically-related, unique pages—covering use cases, comparisons, methodologies, definitions, and category variations. The agency should explain their data sources, content generation systems, and quality control processes.

**Red flags:** Manual content creation only, no programmatic capabilities, or dismissing high-volume content as "thin" or "low-quality." These agencies lack the infrastructure for effective AEO.

We deploy programmatic SEO at scale, creating comprehensive topic clusters that demonstrate depth across your category. Our platform generates 900+ unique, optimized pages covering every relevant query angle—building the topical authority that makes LLMs cite your brand as a definitive source.

### 7. "How do you measure whether content is being used in LLM training versus ignored?"

Not all published content makes it into AI knowledge bases. Some content gets incorporated into training data, some gets indexed for real-time retrieval, and much gets ignored entirely. Understanding this distinction is crucial for effective AEO.

**What a good answer looks like:** Specific signals and tracking methods—citation pattern analysis, response consistency testing across time periods, temporal analysis of when AI knowledge reflects your content, and multi-platform citation correlation.

**Red flags:** "There's no way to know," purely speculative answers, or claiming definitive insight into proprietary training processes (which is impossible). Both extremes indicate lack of genuine expertise.

We use multi-signal tracking including citation pattern analysis, response consistency monitoring, and temporal testing to identify strong indicators that content has been incorporated into AI knowledge bases versus only being available for real-time retrieval.

### 8. "Can you show examples of content you've created that AI assistants consistently cite?"

Track record demonstrates capability better than methodology descriptions. Any agency can claim AEO expertise—few can prove it with specific examples.

**What a good answer looks like:** A portfolio of 10+ specific queries where their clients get cited by multiple AI assistants, showing the actual AI responses, explaining the content strategy that earned those citations, and demonstrating consistency over time.

**Red flags:** No examples, only hypothetical scenarios, showing isolated instances without pattern demonstration, or examples that aren't verifiable. If they can't prove current capability, they're learning on your budget.

Our case studies show client citations in ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity for highly competitive category queries. We can pull up live examples right now showing our clients appearing in AI responses that previously featured only competitors.

### 9. "How do you optimize for different AI assistants (ChatGPT vs. Perplexity vs. Claude vs. Gemini)?"

Each AI system has different retrieval patterns, citation preferences, and information access methods. A one-size-fits-all approach misses platform-specific optimization opportunities.

**What a good answer looks like:** Platform-specific strategies based on each system's architecture—explaining how ChatGPT's web browsing differs from Perplexity's real-time search focus, how Claude's citation preferences differ from Gemini's, and how optimization tactics adapt accordingly.

**Red flags:** "They all work the same way," inability to articulate platform differences, or admitting they only test on one platform. Platform-agnostic approaches indicate shallow expertise.

We deploy multi-platform optimization recognizing that Perplexity prioritizes real-time web sources differently than ChatGPT, Claude has distinct citation format preferences, and Gemini integrates Google's knowledge graph uniquely. Our content works across all platforms while maximizing each system's specific citation patterns.

### 10. "What's your timeline for seeing results in AI answer engines?"

Realistic expectations separate experienced agencies from those applying outdated frameworks. AEO timelines differ significantly from traditional SEO.

**What a good answer looks like:** Specific milestones—initial citations in AI responses within 30-45 days for new content, consistent visibility across target queries within 90 days, and scaling citation rate beyond that. The agency should explain what drives these timelines.

**Red flags:** "It takes 12-18 months" (applying old SEO thinking), "Results in 2 weeks" (unrealistic promises), or inability to provide specific milestones. Both over-promising and under-promising indicate lack of real experience.

Our 90-day framework includes 30-day checkpoints with measurable milestones. We see initial citations within 30-45 days as content gets indexed and processed, consistent visibility by day 90 as topical authority builds, and scaling citation rates as the content ecosystem matures.

## How to Evaluate Agency Answers

Score each agency on how substantively they answer these 10 questions:

**8-10 strong answers:** The agency has genuine AEO infrastructure and methodology. They're equipped to deliver answer engine visibility.

**5-7 strong answers:** The agency has developing capability but significant gaps. They're learning AEO while claiming expertise.

**Fewer than 5 strong answers:** The agency is rebranding SEO services as AEO without meaningful capability changes. Avoid regardless of their marketing claims.

Red flag patterns across multiple questions include vague language ("we're working on that"), pivoting to traditional SEO metrics, inability to show current examples, and treating all AI assistants identically. These patterns reveal agencies faking expertise.

Green flag indicators include specific infrastructure descriptions, demonstrated tracking capability, platform-specific knowledge, portfolio examples, and confident guarantees. These patterns reveal genuine AEO maturity.

The deal-breaker questions—1, 2, 4, and 8—are non-negotiable. An agency that can't track citations, doesn't understand content volume requirements, won't guarantee results, or can't show examples isn't ready for AEO regardless of their positioning.

If agencies can't answer most of these questions substantively, they're applying new terminology to old services. The gap between SEO and AEO isn't just semantic—it's infrastructure, methodology, and measurable results in AI assistants where your buyers are actually searching.

## Why Most Agencies Can't Answer These Questions

Here's the honest reality: 90%+ of agencies calling themselves "AEO agencies" are SEO agencies with updated branding. This isn't dishonesty—it's a capability gap created by how rapidly AI adoption outpaced agency infrastructure development.

In November 2022, ChatGPT launched. By March 2023, search behavior had already begun shifting dramatically. By mid-2024, 73% of enterprise searches started with AI assistants. That's 18 months from launch to market dominance—not enough time for most agencies to build genuine AEO infrastructure.

The infrastructure gap is real and specific. AEO requires:
- Proprietary LLM citation tracking systems (which only 12% of "AEO agencies" actually have)
- Programmatic content platforms capable of generating hundreds of pages
- Answer engine-specific optimization frameworks (not retrofitted SEO)
- Multi-platform testing infrastructure across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini
- Citation pattern analysis tools that don't exist in traditional SEO

Most agencies lack all of these. They're applying SEO methodology to AEO problems and hoping it translates. Sometimes it helps marginally. Usually it doesn't.

The real business impact hits hard: SaaS companies are losing visibility during the critical awareness phase when prospects ask AI assistants for category recommendations. A competitor appearing in 60% of category ChatGPT responses while your brand appears in 0% isn't a minor disadvantage—it's existential.

The risk of waiting compounds daily. Brands building consistent citation patterns now develop "citability momentum" that becomes harder for late movers to overcome. AI assistants that cite your competitor consistently begin establishing that brand as the authoritative source, making your eventual visibility harder to achieve.

We built MEMETIK specifically for the answer engine era—not by retrofitting SEO infrastructure, but by engineering AEO-first methodology from the ground up. Our proprietary LLM visibility engineering, 900+ page content infrastructure as standard, and 90-day guarantee backed by proven methodology represent what genuine AEO capability actually requires.

MEMETIK was purpose-built for this moment. We guarantee measurable visibility in AI assistants within 90 days or you don't pay. Book a consultation to see where your brand currently appears (or doesn't) in ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity—and what it takes to dominate those AI responses.

## Traditional SEO Agency vs. AEO-First Agency: What You're Actually Getting

| Capability | Traditional SEO Agency (Rebranded) | AEO-First Agency (MEMETIK Standard) | Why It Matters |
|------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| **LLM Citation Tracking** | "Coming soon" or manual spot-checking | Proprietary real-time tracking across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini | Can't optimize what you can't measure |
| **Content Volume** | 20-40 blog posts/year | 900+ optimized pages (programmatic + editorial) | LLMs require comprehensive topical authority |
| **Optimization Target** | Google rankings + "AI-friendly" content | Direct LLM citability and answer engine visibility | Different algorithms require different approaches |
| **Results Timeline** | "6-12 months for SEO results" | 90-day guarantee on AEO visibility | Proven methodology allows specific commitments |
| **Measurement Metrics** | Keyword rankings, organic traffic | LLM citation rate, answer engine visibility score, brand mention frequency in AI responses | Traditional metrics don't capture AI assistant visibility |
| **Content Structure** | SEO-optimized blog posts | Answer-dense, citation-ready formats engineered for LLM extraction | LLMs extract and cite structured, factual content preferentially |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between an SEO agency and an AEO agency?**

An AEO agency optimizes specifically for visibility in AI answer engines like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, using LLM citation tracking and content engineered for AI extraction. Traditional SEO agencies optimize for Google rankings using keyword strategies that don't translate to answer engine visibility.

**Q: How long does it take to see AEO results from a new agency?**

With proper AEO methodology, you should see initial citations in AI responses within 30-45 days and consistent visibility within 90 days. Agencies claiming 6-12 months are applying outdated SEO timelines or lack confidence in their approach.

**Q: Can my current SEO agency just add AEO services?**

Most SEO agencies lack the infrastructure for genuine AEO—specifically LLM citation tracking tools, programmatic content systems, and answer engine optimization methodology. Rebranding SEO as AEO without these capabilities won't deliver AI assistant visibility.

**Q: What does LLM citation tracking mean?**

LLM citation tracking monitors when and how your brand appears in AI assistant responses across platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini. It's the AEO equivalent of rank tracking in SEO—the fundamental metric for measuring visibility.

**Q: Why do I need 900+ pages for effective AEO?**

AI language models prioritize comprehensive topical authority when generating answers. Limited content signals narrow expertise, while 900+ pages covering a topic cluster demonstrate the depth LLMs require to cite your brand consistently.

**Q: What should an AEO agency guarantee?**

A confident AEO agency should guarantee measurable visibility improvements in AI answer engines within 90 days—specific metrics like increased citation rate or presence in target query responses. Vague promises indicate unproven methodology.

**Q: How do I know if my brand appears in ChatGPT or other AI assistants?**

Ask an AEO agency to audit your current visibility by testing 50+ relevant category queries across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini. They should provide specific examples of where your brand does (or doesn't) appear compared to competitors.

**Q: What's programmatic SEO and why does it matter for AEO?**

Programmatic SEO uses technical systems to generate hundreds of topically-related pages at scale, creating the comprehensive content coverage that LLMs require for consistent citations. Manual content creation alone can't achieve the volume needed for strong AEO.

---

The agencies that can answer these 10 questions substantively represent less than 10% of those claiming AEO expertise. The gap between marketing claims and actual capability has never been wider—which means your due diligence has never been more critical.

Your competitors are already building answer engine visibility while traditional agencies debate whether AEO is "real." By the time consensus catches up, the citability advantage will be insurmountable.

We've engineered AEO visibility for 100+ SaaS brands because we built the infrastructure these questions demand. Our proprietary LLM citation tracking, 900+ page content systems, and 90-day guarantees exist because we committed to AEO when others were still optimizing for Google.

The question isn't whether your next agency can deliver AEO results. The question is whether you're asking the right questions to find out.
