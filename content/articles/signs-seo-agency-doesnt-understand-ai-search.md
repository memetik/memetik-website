An SEO agency that doesn't understand AI search optimization will focus exclusively on Google rankings while ignoring AI-powered search platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude that now answer 68% of informational queries without users clicking to websites. If your agency isn't tracking citations in large language models (LLMs), testing content visibility in AI responses, or reporting on Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) metrics, they're optimizing for yesterday's search landscape. Six critical warning signs—from lacking AI citation tracking to never mentioning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—reveal whether your agency has evolved beyond traditional SEO tactics.

## TL;DR

- 68% of informational searches are now answered directly by AI platforms without generating website clicks, making traditional SEO metrics incomplete
- Modern SEO agencies should track citations in at least 4-6 AI platforms including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini, not just Google rankings
- Agencies unfamiliar with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) cannot optimize content for how AI systems actually retrieve and cite information
- Only 23% of traditional SEO agencies currently test content performance in LLM responses, creating a massive optimization blind spot
- Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) requires structured content infrastructure with schema markup, FAQ formats, and citation-friendly formatting that 76% of agencies still neglect
- AI-forward agencies provide monthly reports showing citation frequency, source attribution rates, and visibility scores across multiple AI platforms
- The shift from SEO to AEO represents evolution not incompetence—agencies can adapt, but you need to evaluate whether your current partner is making the transition

## The Search Landscape Changed While You Weren't Looking

You hired your SEO agency two or three years ago based on solid credentials—strong Google rankings, steady organic traffic growth, and a portfolio of successful campaigns. They delivered exactly what they promised: your website climbed the SERPs, your domain authority increased, and your analytics showed healthy visitor numbers.

But something shifted in the past 18 months that your monthly reports aren't capturing.

Your sales team keeps hearing prospects say they've "already done extensive research" before reaching out, yet you have no visibility into where that research happened. Your qualified demo requests have plateaued despite steady traffic. And when you ask prospects how they found you, fewer mention Google and more reference "looking into different solutions" without specifying where.

Here's what changed: B2B buyers now complete 83% of their research before contacting sales, and roughly 68% of that research happens through AI assistants rather than traditional search engines. Your prospects are asking ChatGPT to compare solutions, querying Perplexity for best practices, and using Claude to analyze vendor capabilities—all without ever clicking through to your website.

If your SEO agency hasn't mentioned this shift, they're optimizing for a search landscape that no longer exists.

This article provides six diagnostic warning signs that reveal whether your agency partner has made the transition from traditional SEO to AI-powered search optimization. Think of this as a health check for your current partnership, not a termination notice. Many excellent agencies are adapting—the question is whether yours is one of them.

## The 6 Warning Signs Your Agency Is Stuck in 2022

### Sign #1: Zero AI Citation Tracking in Monthly Reports

Open your last three monthly reports from your SEO agency. You'll likely see comprehensive data on Google rankings, organic traffic trends, backlink acquisition, and domain authority metrics. All valuable information—for traditional search.

Now look for a section on "AI Visibility" or "LLM Citations" or "Answer Engine Performance." If those sections don't exist, your agency is measuring only half the funnel—the half that's rapidly declining in importance.

Modern agencies track how many times your brand appears in ChatGPT responses, which of your content pieces Perplexity cites, and how frequently Claude references your expertise when answering buyer questions. They monitor these metrics across 4-6 AI platforms because that's where your prospects are actually researching.

**The quick test:** Ask your agency, "How many times was our brand cited by ChatGPT last month?" If they can't answer within 24 hours with actual data, that's Sign #1.

The implications extend beyond vanity metrics. AI citation frequency directly correlates with early-stage buyer awareness. When your competitor appears in AI-generated research summaries and you don't, they've established credibility before prospects even know you exist.

### Sign #2: They've Never Mentioned RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation sounds technical because it is—it's the foundation of how AI search actually works. RAG is the mechanism ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI platforms use to pull information from the web in real-time when answering questions.

If your agency hasn't explained RAG or discussed how to optimize content for retrieval pipelines, they don't understand the mechanism behind AI search. That's like hiring an SEO agency in 2015 that couldn't explain how Google's crawler worked.

Optimizing for RAG requires fundamentally different content structure than traditional SEO. Instead of keyword density and backlink profiles, RAG optimization focuses on source attribution clarity, factual statement structure, and citation-friendly formatting that helps AI systems extract and attribute information accurately.

**The quick test:** Ask your agency to explain how RAG affects content strategy and what they're doing to optimize for it. If you get blank stares or generic responses about "creating quality content," that's Sign #2.

We've built our entire content infrastructure around RAG optimization because we understand this is how AI platforms decide which sources to cite. Our programmatic SEO system deploys 900+ pages structured specifically for AI retrieval—the volume and format AI systems prefer.

### Sign #3: No Testing in AI Platforms

Here's what separates agencies that talk about AI search from those actually optimizing for it: consistent testing.

Modern agencies don't just publish content and hope AI platforms find it. They actively test by querying ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other platforms with the exact questions your buyers ask. They document which content gets cited, how often, and in what context. They run these tests weekly, sometimes daily, creating a feedback loop that continuously improves AI visibility.

**The quick test:** Ask your agency, "Can you show me examples of our content being cited in ChatGPT or Perplexity?" If they've never actually looked—never queried these platforms to see if your content appears—that's Sign #3.

**[See how we track AI citations across 6 platforms—request a sample AI Visibility Report for your brand.](#)**

This isn't optional detective work. You can't optimize what you don't measure. Agencies that aren't testing in AI platforms are flying blind, publishing content with zero visibility into whether it achieves the objective of appearing in AI-generated responses.

The testing infrastructure requires dedicated resources—query templates that mirror buyer questions, citation tracking spreadsheets, comparison databases to benchmark against competitors, and analysis frameworks to identify patterns in what gets cited. Most traditional agencies haven't built these systems because they're still focused exclusively on Google.

### Sign #4: All Strategy Conversations Focus on Google

Pay attention to your next strategy meeting with your agency. Count how many times they mention "ranking #1 on Google," "improving search visibility," or "beating competitors in the SERPs." Now count how many times they mention answer engines, AI platforms, Perplexity, or AEO.

If the ratio is 10:0, you've identified Sign #4.

Google remains important—no question. But agencies stuck in traditional SEO frameworks only discuss the traditional metrics: keyword rankings, backlinks, domain authority, and organic traffic. They never mention answer engines, source attribution, or LLM visibility because those concepts aren't part of their operational vocabulary.

The entire search landscape has become AI-augmented. Google itself now generates AI Overviews for millions of queries, synthesizing information from multiple sources instead of just listing links. Your buyers use ChatGPT for research, Perplexity for comparisons, and Claude for analysis—often without ever touching Google.

Strategy conversations that ignore this reality optimize for a shrinking slice of the buyer journey. Your agency should discuss multi-platform visibility strategies, not just Google tactics.

### Sign #5: No Schema Markup Strategy for AI Consumption

Schema markup is structured data that helps search engines and AI platforms understand your content. It's been available for years, but most traditional SEO agencies implement it superficially or not at all.

AI platforms rely heavily on schema markup to extract and cite information. FAQPage schema, Article schema, HowTo schema, and other structured data formats provide the machine-readable context AI systems need to confidently cite your content.

If your agency isn't implementing comprehensive schema markup specifically designed for AI consumption—not just basic schema for Google rich snippets—they're missing the technical foundation of AEO.

**The quick test:** Ask, "What schema markup have you implemented to help AI platforms cite our content?" If you get vague answers about "we use standard schema" without specifics about FAQ, Article, and HowTo implementations, that's Sign #5.

We implement advanced schema markup across all programmatically generated content because we know it dramatically increases citation probability. Our technical infrastructure automatically adds appropriate schema to every page, creating the structured data layer AI platforms depend on for accurate information extraction.

### Sign #6: They Don't Understand AEO vs. SEO

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is a distinct discipline focused on getting cited by AI-powered search platforms. It's related to SEO—they share some principles—but AEO requires different tactics, different metrics, and different success criteria.

If your agency uses "SEO" and "AEO" interchangeably, or has never heard the term AEO, they haven't evolved their service offering to match the current search ecosystem.

**The quick test:** Ask, "What's your AEO strategy for our brand?" If they respond by describing traditional SEO tactics—keyword optimization, link building, technical SEO—without addressing citation optimization, source attribution, or AI platform visibility, that's Sign #6.

AEO requires content formatted for direct answers, structured for easy extraction, and optimized for source attribution. These aren't the same skills as ranking content on Google, though there's overlap. Agencies that conflate the two haven't recognized that the game fundamentally changed.

## What These Six Signs Actually Mean

Individually, each warning sign suggests a knowledge gap. Collectively, three or more signals indicate your agency is systematically optimizing for 2022's search landscape while your buyers have moved on to 2025's AI-powered research tools.

This creates three specific business problems for SaaS companies:

**Invisible buyer research phase.** Your prospects spend weeks researching solutions in AI platforms where you have zero visibility. They form opinions, shortlist vendors, and develop preferences before your analytics ever register their existence. You're losing the battle for mindshare before you know it started.

**Competitive disadvantage.** If your competitors work with AEO-capable agencies, they appear in AI-generated research summaries, comparison responses, and best-practice recommendations while you don't. The visibility gap compounds over time as AI platforms learn which sources provide reliable, well-structured information.

**Wasted budget allocation.** You're paying for "search optimization" that addresses perhaps 40% of where your buyers actually search. The majority of your budget optimizes for Google while 60% of buyer research happens elsewhere. That's not just inefficient—it's strategically misaligned with buyer behavior.

Here's the crucial nuance: These warning signs don't mean your agency is incompetent at traditional SEO. They might be excellent at improving Google rankings, building quality backlinks, and driving organic traffic. Those skills have value.

But the search industry evolved rapidly between 2023 and 2025. Agencies that haven't adapted aren't bad—they're behind. The question is whether they're capable of catching up or whether you need a partner already operating at the frontier.

## Your Three Options (And How to Choose)

Identifying these gaps creates a decision point. You have three viable options, each appropriate for different situations.

### Option 1: Educate Your Current Agency

If your agency has been responsive, delivered solid traditional SEO results, and demonstrates genuine curiosity about emerging trends, education might work.

Share this article. Request a 90-day AI optimization roadmap that addresses the six warning signs. Ask them to add AEO services, implement AI citation tracking, and begin LLM testing.

Many quality agencies are actively working to adapt. They recognize the shift but haven't fully operationalized AEO services yet. If your agency is in this category and shows genuine commitment to learning, giving them a quarter to demonstrate progress can preserve a productive partnership.

Look for specific commitments: "We'll implement schema markup across all content by day 30, begin ChatGPT and Perplexity testing by day 45, and deliver our first AI visibility report by day 90."

### Option 2: Supplement with AEO-Specialist Support

If your current agency excels at traditional SEO but lacks AI capabilities, you can take a best-of-both-worlds approach.

Keep your existing agency for Google optimization, backlink building, and technical SEO. Supplement with an AEO-specialist partner to handle AI platform visibility, citation optimization, and structured content deployment.

This approach works particularly well when you have a strong existing SEO foundation but need to expand into AI search without disrupting what's working. It allows gradual transition rather than complete replacement.

We often work alongside traditional SEO agencies in this capacity, focusing exclusively on AI visibility while they continue managing Google optimization. The key is clear role definition so nothing falls through the cracks.

### Option 3: Transition to an AEO-First Agency

If your current agency dismisses AI search importance, shows no interest in adapting, or can't articulate a credible roadmap for adding these capabilities, full transition becomes necessary.

Look for agencies with proven AI visibility capabilities, not just promises to "figure it out." Key criteria include:

- **Actual AI citation tracking infrastructure** with monthly reporting across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other platforms
- **Technical AEO capabilities** including advanced schema implementation, content structuring for RAG, and source attribution optimization
- **Systematic testing methodology** with regular LLM queries to measure citation frequency
- **Content infrastructure** capable of creating the volume of structured content AI platforms prefer (hundreds or thousands of citation-optimized pages)
- **Performance guarantees** that demonstrate confidence in their AEO methodology

At MEMETIK, we offer a 90-day AI visibility guarantee because our programmatic SEO infrastructure and AEO-first methodology consistently deliver measurable citation improvements within that window. We've built the testing systems, schema frameworks, and content deployment capabilities that take traditional agencies years to develop—because we started with AEO as the foundation, not an afterthought.

## Your Next Steps: Taking Action This Week

The six warning signs provide a diagnostic framework, but diagnosis without action changes nothing. Here's how to move forward:

**This week:** Schedule a candid conversation with your agency using these six signs as the agenda. Don't present it as an ultimatum—frame it as a strategic alignment discussion. "The buyer research landscape has shifted to AI platforms. I need to understand our capabilities in this area."

**In the meeting:** Request current AI visibility data. If they don't track it yet, acknowledge that directly and ask for a specific plan to begin measuring these metrics. The quality of their response—defensive dismissal versus genuine curiosity—tells you everything about their adaptability.

**Request specifics:** A credible AEO roadmap should include 90-day milestones with measurable outcomes. "Month 1: Implement FAQ and Article schema across 50 priority pages. Month 2: Begin weekly testing in ChatGPT and Perplexity, establish citation baseline. Month 3: Deploy first iteration of structured content optimization, report AI visibility improvements."

**Set accountability:** Going forward, your monthly reports should include AI visibility metrics alongside traditional SEO data. Citations in major AI platforms, source attribution rates, and visibility scores across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude belong in every report—not as optional add-ons but as core KPIs.

**Timeline consideration:** If your agency responds positively and commits to specific deliverables, give them 60-90 days to demonstrate progress before making changes. That's enough time to implement initial AEO infrastructure and show measurable improvement in AI citations.

**Decision point:** If your agency dismisses AI search as a passing trend, insists traditional SEO is sufficient, or can't articulate a credible AEO roadmap, you have your answer. The opportunity cost of staying with a backward-looking partner exceeds the transition cost of finding an AEO-capable alternative.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How can I tell if my SEO agency understands AI search optimization?**

Ask if they track citations in AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity—modern agencies report AI visibility metrics monthly alongside Google rankings. If they've never mentioned AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), they haven't adapted to AI-powered search.

**Q: What is AEO and how is it different from SEO?**

AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) focuses on getting cited by AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude, while traditional SEO targets Google rankings. AEO requires structured content, schema markup, and citation-friendly formatting that helps AI systems retrieve and attribute your information.

**Q: Should I fire my SEO agency if they don't understand AI search?**

Not immediately—first share your concerns and request an AEO roadmap with 90-day milestones. Many quality agencies are adapting to AI search; give receptive partners a chance to evolve before making a change.

**Q: What is RAG and why does my SEO agency need to understand it?**

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is the technology AI platforms use to pull information from the web when answering questions. Agencies that understand RAG can optimize content structure, formatting, and metadata to increase retrieval probability and citation rates.

**Q: How much does my business lose if my agency only optimizes for Google?**

With 68% of informational searches now answered by AI platforms without clicks to websites, optimizing only for Google means you're invisible during the majority of B2B buyer research. This creates massive opportunity cost, especially for SaaS companies with long sales cycles.

**Q: What AI platforms should my agency be tracking besides Google?**

At minimum, your agency should monitor ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google's AI Overviews. We track 6-8 platforms including Gemini, Copilot, and vertical-specific AI tools your buyers use.

**Q: Can a traditional SEO agency add AEO capabilities or do I need a specialist?**

Some traditional agencies successfully adapt by adding AI citation tracking, schema expertise, and LLM testing. However, AEO specialists have built infrastructure—programmatic content systems, multi-platform testing frameworks—that takes years to develop from scratch.

**Q: What's a realistic timeline to see results from AEO optimization?**

We demonstrate measurable AI citation improvement within 60-90 days through structured content deployment and schema optimization. Our 90-day guarantee reflects the realistic timeline for proper AEO implementation to show results.

---

The search landscape changed faster than most agencies adapted. Your buyers now research in AI platforms where traditional SEO tactics don't apply. You hired experts to keep you ahead of search trends—it's reasonable to expect they've evolved with the industry.

Whether your current agency adapts or you partner with an AEO specialist, getting this right positions your SaaS company for the next decade of search. The six warning signs give you a framework to assess where things stand. The three options provide a path forward. What matters now is taking action while your competitors are still figuring out that the game changed.
