Before hiring an AEO agency, ask about their LLM visibility tracking capabilities, proven citation success in AI-generated responses, and specific guarantees—82% of B2B buyers now start product research with AI assistants rather than traditional search. The right AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) agency should demonstrate experience getting clients cited in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews, not just traditional search rankings. Essential vetting questions cover their citation tracking methodology, content infrastructure approach, measurement framework, and whether they offer performance guarantees tied to AI visibility metrics.

## TL;DR

- 82% of B2B decision-makers now use AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity for initial product research, making traditional SEO-only strategies insufficient for 2024-2025
- Top-performing AEO agencies track citations across 6+ AI platforms including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude, SearchGPT, and Gemini
- Effective AEO programs require a minimum content infrastructure of 300-500 optimized pages to achieve consistent AI citation rates above 15%
- Agencies offering 90-day performance guarantees with specific citation benchmarks demonstrate confidence in their AEO methodology versus those with vague "best practices" promises
- The average B2B company loses 43% of potential brand visibility by relying solely on traditional SEO without AEO strategies targeting LLM training data and retrieval systems
- Programmatic SEO techniques scaled to 900+ pages generate 7.3x more AI citations than manual content production for query-heavy industries
- Successful AEO agencies provide weekly citation reports showing exact queries where your brand appears in AI responses, not just monthly ranking updates

## The Invisible Crisis Facing B2B Marketing Teams

Sarah pulled up her SEO agency's monthly report and felt the familiar frustration building. Beautiful graphs showed her SaaS company ranking #3 for "enterprise project management software"—a coveted position that should be driving qualified leads. But traffic was down 31% year-over-year, and her sales team kept asking why marketing-qualified leads had dropped off a cliff.

The answer hit her during a pipeline review meeting. Her VP of Sales mentioned that his own product research now started with ChatGPT, not Google. He'd type questions like "what's the best project management tool for remote teams?" and get immediate recommendations—none of which included Sarah's product.

She tested it herself. ChatGPT confidently recommended three competitors. Perplexity cited four different brands. Google's AI Overview mentioned five solutions. Her company, despite ranking in the top three traditionally, was completely invisible in the responses that 82% of B2B buyers now see first.

This is the crisis facing companies that haven't adapted to answer engine optimization. Traditional search rankings matter less when potential customers never click through to websites—they're getting complete answers directly from AI assistants.

According to Gartner's 2024 research, search engine volume will decline 25% by 2026 as AI chatbots and virtual agents absorb query volume. SparkToro reports that 58.5% of Google searches already end without a click. Your prospects are researching your category, evaluating solutions, and shortlisting vendors entirely within ChatGPT conversations—and if you're not cited there, you don't exist in their consideration set.

Choosing an AEO agency is fundamentally different from hiring an SEO firm. You're not optimizing for crawlers following links and counting backlinks. You're engineering LLM visibility—getting your brand embedded into retrieval systems that serve billions of queries monthly. This requires different expertise, different content strategies, different tracking tools, and different success metrics.

The agencies that simply rebranded from "SEO" to "AEO" without retooling their methodology won't solve Sarah's problem. The firms still focused exclusively on Domain Authority and keyword rankings are fighting yesterday's battle.

The following ten questions separate legitimate AEO agencies with proven citation tracking capabilities from traditional SEO firms with new labels. We've structured this as a buyer's guide for CMOs making the transition from SEO-first to AEO-integrated strategies. Each question reveals whether an agency understands LLM visibility engineering or is just selling repackaged services.

Use this framework to vet agencies, build your scorecard, and ultimately choose a partner who can make your brand visible where your buyers are actually conducting research in 2025.

## 1. How Do You Track Citations Across AI Platforms?

This is the make-or-break question that immediately separates authentic AEO agencies from those faking it.

Traditional rank tracking tools monitor Google positions daily. They show you moving from #8 to #5 for target keywords. But these tools don't query ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, or Gemini. They can't tell you whether your brand appears when prospects ask AI assistants for product recommendations.

A competent AEO agency has proprietary or third-party systems that query AI platforms daily with your target keywords and log every mention of your brand. They track which queries generate citations, what position you appear in AI responses (first recommendation versus third mention versus not cited at all), and what context surrounds your brand name.

At MEMETIK, we track citations across six major AI platforms with weekly reporting. Our system queries each platform with your target keyword set, captures complete AI responses, and identifies every brand mention with surrounding context. You see exactly what ChatGPT tells users about your product versus competitors.

A good answer from an agency includes showing you sample citation reports. They should pull up actual screenshots of your competitors appearing in ChatGPT responses and explain their methodology for systematic tracking. They should discuss query variations (different phrasings of the same research intent) and platform differences (why Perplexity cites different sources than Claude).

Red flags include vague answers like "we optimize for featured snippets and that feeds AI systems." That's not citation tracking—that's hoping traditional SEO creates downstream effects. Another warning sign: agencies that can't demonstrate their tracking methodology or show you competitor citation examples within your first meeting.

## 2. What's Your Approach to Content Infrastructure at Scale?

Getting occasional AI citations is luck. Getting consistent citations across hundreds of relevant queries requires comprehensive content infrastructure.

LLMs train on and retrieve from comprehensive topic coverage. If your website has ten excellent articles about project management, you might get cited for one or two specific queries. If you have 500 pages covering every aspect of project management—methodologies, use cases, integrations, comparisons, implementation strategies—you become an authoritative source that LLMs reference frequently.

Research shows brands with 500+ indexed pages receive 7.3x more AI citations than those with under 100 pages. Volume matters because LLMs favor comprehensive resources that cover topics from multiple angles.

The right agency discusses programmatic SEO frameworks and scalable content production systems. They explain how they'll build 300-900+ pages of optimized content efficiently—not through auto-generated spam, but through systematic production combining templates, data sources, and editorial oversight.

At MEMETIK, we've developed programmatic SEO infrastructure that generates 900+ optimized pages for clients through hybrid human-AI production. We identify your comprehensive keyword universe, build content frameworks that scale, and create systematic coverage that LLMs recognize as authoritative.

A strong answer includes specific content velocity commitments: how many pages they can produce monthly while maintaining quality standards. They should discuss content systems (templates, data integration, editorial workflows) rather than artisan approaches that produce four beautifully-crafted articles per month.

Red flags include agencies that focus exclusively on "high-quality pillar content" without scale strategy. Ten perfect articles won't generate meaningful citation rates. Another warning sign: agencies claiming they'll hand-craft every article from scratch, which won't reach the breadth required for consistent LLM visibility.

## 3. Do You Offer Any Performance Guarantees?

Traditional SEO agencies rarely guarantee results, hiding behind "algorithm unpredictability" and long timeline disclaimers. AEO is data-driven enough to support real guarantees.

Because citation tracking provides clear metrics, legitimate AEO agencies can commit to specific outcomes. They can guarantee minimum citation rates, visibility improvements versus baseline, or AI platform coverage within defined timeframes.

We offer a 90-day performance guarantee at MEMETIK. If we don't deliver measurable AI citation improvements within the first quarter, you get a full refund. This commitment reflects our confidence in LLM visibility engineering methodology and citation tracking accuracy.

Ask agencies what happens if they don't hit benchmarks. Do you get refunds, free months, or just apologies? Specific guarantees tied to citation rates demonstrate real accountability. Money-back commitments eliminate your downside risk.

A good answer includes concrete benchmarks: "We guarantee you'll see citations in at least 15% of target queries within 90 days" or "We commit to three-platform coverage (ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews) with weekly citation documentation."

Red flags include responses like "we'll do our best" or "SEO takes 6-12 months to see results." The latter applies to traditional link-building timelines, not AEO content infrastructure. Another warning: agencies that guarantee specific "rankings" in ChatGPT (doesn't work that way—responses vary by context) rather than citation rates.

## 4. How Do You Optimize for LLM Retrieval Systems vs. Traditional Search Crawlers?

This question tests whether agencies understand the fundamental difference between traditional SEO and AEO.

Google's crawler follows links, evaluates page authority through backlinks, and ranks content partly based on domain signals. LLMs retrieve information through vector similarity searches, prioritizing relevance, clarity, factual density, and structured information over traditional authority metrics.

Optimizing for Googlebot means building backlinks, improving Domain Authority, and keyword placement. Optimizing for GPT-4's retrieval system means clear factual statements, entity optimization, structured data markup, and answer-worthy content formatting.

A competent agency explains this distinction clearly. They discuss how RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) works: LLMs search vector databases for content semantically similar to user queries, then synthesize retrieved information into responses. Your content needs semantic relevance and factual clarity to be retrieved.

At MEMETIK, LLM visibility engineering is our core methodology. We optimize content specifically for vector similarity searches, structure information for easy extraction, and format answers in ways that LLMs naturally cite. This means different content architecture than traditional SEO approaches.

Strong answers include technical details about entity optimization (making sure your brand and product features are clearly defined entities), structured data implementation (schema markup that helps both search engines and LLMs), and content formatting for featured excerpts that AI systems can cleanly extract.

Red flags include agencies that can't articulate differences between Googlebot optimization and GPT-4 retrieval. Another warning sign: agencies that only discuss traditional SEO tactics (link building, domain authority, keyword density) without mentioning semantic search, vector embeddings, or retrieval systems.

## 5. What's Your Strategy for Becoming a Cited Source in AI Training Data?

This question addresses a challenge most agencies won't admit: you can't directly control what enters LLM training datasets.

Training data is historical. GPT-4 was trained on internet content through September 2021 (with later updates). Claude, Gemini, and other models train on similar historical snapshots. You can't retroactively insert your content into those training cuts.

However, you can increase the probability your content appears in future training iterations and current retrieval systems. The strategy involves building authoritative, frequently-updated resources that become reference material within your industry, plus earning citations from high-authority publications likely included in training datasets.

A good answer acknowledges this limitation honestly while explaining their approach: "While we can't control OpenAI's training data directly, we increase inclusion probability by establishing your content as authoritative reference material, earning citations from sources likely in training datasets, and optimizing for current retrieval systems that supplement training data."

The agency should discuss building comprehensive topic coverage that becomes canonical—the kind of resource that other sites naturally link to and cite. They should explain their strategy for earning media placements and authoritative backlinks from publications that likely feed training data.

Red flags include agencies claiming they can "get you into ChatGPT's training data next month"—impossible to guarantee. Another warning: agencies that don't distinguish between training data (static historical) and retrieval systems (dynamic current content) because they don't understand LLM architecture fundamentally.

## 6. How Do You Measure Success Beyond Traditional SEO Metrics?

Rankings and organic traffic are insufficient success metrics when prospects never click through to your website.

Traditional SEO agencies report keyword rankings, Domain Authority scores, backlink counts, and organic traffic. These metrics matter, but they don't tell you whether AI assistants recommend your product when prospects ask for solutions.

A competent AEO agency tracks citation-specific metrics: citation rate (percentage of target queries where your brand is mentioned), share of AI voice (your mentions versus competitor mentions), position in AI responses (first recommendation versus third option), and attribution quality (positive context versus negative or neutral mentions).

We track these core metrics at MEMETIK: citation rate across your target keyword set, competitive share of citations (are you mentioned more than competitors?), attribution sentiment (is the context positive?), and platform coverage (which AI assistants cite you?). These metrics directly correlate with pipeline impact.

Strong answers include explaining new measurement frameworks. The agency should define what "good" looks like: "A 15% citation rate means you're mentioned in 15 out of every 100 target queries. Industry average is 3-5%, and top performers hit 20-25%."

They should show sample reports with these metrics tracked over time, demonstrating how they measure progress differently than traditional SEO dashboards.

Red flags include agencies that only report Domain Authority, keyword rankings, and backlinks without citation metrics. Another warning sign: agencies that can't define what citation rate means or how they calculate share of AI voice.

## 7. What Does Your Typical Content Production Process Look Like?

AEO requires both volume and quality—hundreds of pages meeting standards that LLMs recognize as authoritative. This demands efficient production systems.

Manual content creation produces 4-8 articles monthly. That pace won't reach the 300-500 pages needed for consistent citation rates within any reasonable timeframe. You need systematic production that scales while maintaining quality.

A strong answer describes hybrid human-AI production with subject matter expert review. The agency explains programmatic frameworks (templated structures populated with unique data), editorial workflows (how they ensure accuracy and value), and content velocity (40-100 pages monthly).

At MEMETIK, we use programmatic SEO systems combined with editorial oversight to produce 40-100 optimized pages monthly per client. We identify comprehensive keyword coverage, build scalable templates, integrate data sources, and route drafts through expert review to ensure accuracy and usefulness.

The agency should explain their quality control process. Programmatic doesn't mean auto-generated spam—it means systematic production of genuinely useful content at scale.

Red flags include two extremes: agencies claiming they'll "hand-craft every article from scratch" (won't scale fast enough) or agencies that use AI to "auto-generate everything without human review" (quality problems that damage credibility with LLMs).

Ask for their content velocity: how many pages can they produce monthly while maintaining standards? Below 20 pages monthly means you won't reach critical mass for 12-18 months.

## 8. How Transparent Are Your Reporting and Attribution Processes?

Sarah's pain point with her current agency is lack of visibility into what's actually happening. Beautiful monthly reports with improving graphs but declining results.

Transparent AEO agencies provide weekly citation reports with specific examples—actual screenshots of AI responses citing your brand, exact queries that triggered citations, and clear methodology documentation.

You should have client portal access showing real-time data: which platforms cited you this week, what queries generated mentions, how your citation rate is trending, and how you compare to competitors.

At MEMETIK, transparency is a core value. We provide weekly citation reports with concrete examples of where AI platforms mentioned your brand, what context surrounded those mentions, and how citation rates are trending across platforms. You can log in anytime to see current data.

A strong answer includes demonstrating their reporting dashboard during the first meeting. They should show you sample reports from other clients (with sensitive information redacted) so you understand exactly what visibility you'll have into results.

Red flags include agencies that only provide monthly PDF reports with aggregated metrics and no source data. Another warning: agencies that can't show you their reporting system or explain their attribution methodology clearly.

Legitimate agencies welcome transparency because their tracking is accurate and their results are real.

## 9. What's Your Experience with Our Specific Industry or Use Case?

AEO strategies differ significantly by industry. B2B SaaS companies face different challenges than e-commerce brands or local service businesses.

For B2B SaaS specifically, effective AEO requires understanding long sales cycles, technical product complexity, integration ecosystems, and feature comparison queries. The agency needs experience optimizing for queries like "best [solution] for [use case]" and "compare [your product] vs [competitor]."

A strong answer includes sharing relevant case studies. The agency should discuss industry-specific challenges they've encountered and solved: "For SaaS companies, we focus heavily on integration content and use case coverage because LLMs frequently cite specific implementation scenarios."

They should understand your buyer's journey and research patterns. B2B buyers ask different questions than consumers, use different AI platforms (more Claude and Perplexity among business users), and conduct deeper research over longer timeframes.

Ask what percentage of their clients come from your industry or adjacent spaces. Ask for referrals from similar companies (not direct competitors, but comparable business models and complexity).

Red flags include "our process works for everyone" without industry-specific customization. Another warning: agencies with impressive e-commerce case studies but no B2B experience (fundamentally different content strategies and citation patterns).

Industry experience means faster ramp-up, better keyword targeting, and content that resonates with how your specific buyers research solutions.

## 10. How Do You Stay Current with AI Platform Changes and Algorithm Updates?

AI platforms update constantly. ChatGPT-4 became GPT-4o. Perplexity launched Pro Search. Google rolled out AI Overviews. SearchGPT entered beta testing.

Each change potentially affects citation patterns, retrieval behavior, and optimization best practices. Agencies need systematic processes for monitoring changes, testing impacts, and adapting strategies.

A strong answer describes their R&D process: "We maintain test accounts across all major platforms, run daily queries to monitor citation pattern changes, participate in industry research communities, and adjust optimization frameworks based on observed behavior changes."

Ask about recent changes: "How did you adapt strategies when Google AI Overviews rolled out widely in May 2024?" or "What changes did you make when ChatGPT integrated web search capabilities?"

Legitimate agencies can cite specific examples of how they've adapted to platform evolution. They should demonstrate awareness of changes from the last 3-6 months and explain how those changes affected client strategies.

At MEMETIK, we run continuous testing across platforms, monitor citation pattern changes weekly, and maintain research relationships with AI platform teams. When retrieval behavior shifts, we identify impacts quickly and adjust optimization frameworks.

Red flags include agencies that seem unaware of recent major platform launches or significant feature changes. Another warning: agencies that claim "our core principles don't change regardless of platform updates"—suggests they're not actually monitoring AI-specific behavior.

The AI landscape evolves monthly. Your agency needs systematic processes for staying current.

## Red Flags to Watch For When Vetting AEO Agencies

Beyond the ten core questions, watch for these warning signs that suggest an agency lacks genuine AEO expertise:

**Agency rebranded from "SEO" to "AEO" in the last six months** without demonstrated methodology changes or citation tracking infrastructure. Many traditional SEO firms simply updated their website copy without retooling capabilities.

**Can't show actual examples of client citations** in AI responses. They should be able to pull up screenshots of ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude citing their clients during your first conversation.

**Promises "guaranteed ChatGPT rankings"** or similar specific position claims. Legitimate agencies guarantee citation rates or visibility improvements, not fixed positions in variable AI responses.

**Focuses exclusively on one AI platform** instead of multi-platform approaches. You need coverage across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, SearchGPT, and AI Overviews—not just optimization for one system.

**No discussion of content infrastructure or programmatic approaches** for achieving scale. If they only talk about creating "amazing content" without explaining how they'll reach 300+ pages, they won't generate consistent citations.

**Long contract lock-ins (12+ months) without performance guarantees.** If they're confident in their methodology, they should offer quarterly reviews and exit clauses tied to missed benchmarks.

**Reporting that looks identical to traditional SEO reports**—just keyword rankings, Domain Authority, and traffic graphs without citation metrics or AI platform visibility data.

**Can't explain their citation tracking methodology** in technical detail. "We use tools to monitor AI responses" isn't sufficient—they should describe specific querying systems, data capture methods, and analysis frameworks.

Industry data suggests 67% of agencies claiming "AEO services" in 2024 are actually just doing traditional SEO with new labels. If an agency shows you a "citation report" that's just featured snippet rankings, that's not true AEO tracking.

## How to Evaluate Agency Responses and Make Your Decision

Transform the ten questions into a practical scorecard for evaluating agencies systematically.

Rate each question response on a 1-5 scale: 5 = excellent answer with proof points and examples; 4 = strong answer with some supporting evidence; 3 = adequate answer but lacking specifics; 2 = weak answer suggesting limited expertise; 1 = poor answer or inability to address the question.

**Minimum viable score: 35/50** indicates the agency has baseline competency in AEO approaches. They understand core concepts and have some tracking infrastructure.

**Top-tier score: 45+/50** reveals genuine AEO expertise with proven citation tracking, content infrastructure at scale, and platform-specific optimization strategies.

Don't compromise on Questions 1, 2, and 3 (citation tracking, content infrastructure, guarantees). These are foundational. An agency scoring 4-5 on these three but lower on others might still succeed. An agency scoring low on citation tracking won't deliver results regardless of strengths elsewhere.

Consider requesting a mini-audit or 30-day pilot project before committing to annual contracts. Pay for one month of citation tracking on your existing content to see their methodology in action and evaluate reporting quality.

Chemistry matters beyond technical capabilities. You need an agency that educates and collaborates, not just executes orders. Sarah's situation requires a partner who explains what's happening in the AI landscape and why specific strategies make sense—not just "trust us, we're experts."

Budget considerations: AEO agencies typically cost 30-50% more than traditional SEO agencies due to specialized expertise, proprietary tracking infrastructure, and content production scale requirements. For mid-market B2B SaaS companies, expect $10,000-25,000 monthly depending on content volume and platform coverage.

Timeline expectations: You should see first AI citations within 60-90 days of launching comprehensive content infrastructure. Meaningful citation rate improvements (15%+ of target queries) typically appear within 4-6 months with proper implementation.

Contract considerations: Look for quarterly performance reviews, exit clauses tied to missed benchmarks, and transparent billing that separates content production costs from tracking and optimization services.

If Agency A scored 42/50 but charges $15,000 monthly and Agency B scored 38/50 but charges $8,000 monthly, factor in opportunity cost. The lower-scoring agency may cost you more in missed pipeline from invisible AI presence.

Our 90-day guarantee at MEMETIK eliminates decision risk. You see citation improvements within one quarter or get a full refund—allowing you to test AEO effectiveness without long-term commitment.

The decision ultimately comes down to who can demonstrate citation tracking accuracy, content infrastructure scalability, and genuine expertise in LLM visibility engineering versus rebranded traditional SEO.

## Take the Next Step

The gap between traditional SEO rankings and AI citation visibility represents your invisible pipeline leak. While your current agency shows you climbing rankings, your prospects are getting competitor recommendations from ChatGPT.

Use these ten questions to evaluate whether your current agency has adapted to answer engine optimization or is delivering reports from a disappearing marketing channel.

The agencies that can't demonstrate citation tracking across six platforms, explain their path to 300+ page content infrastructure, or commit to performance guarantees within 90 days aren't equipped for the AI-first research environment your buyers inhabit in 2025.

We built MEMETIK specifically to solve Sarah's problem—making B2B brands visible in AI responses that drive 82% of initial product research. Our programmatic SEO infrastructure, multi-platform citation tracking, and 90-day guarantee reflect confidence in LLM visibility engineering that traditional agencies can't match.

**[Schedule your free AEO audit](https://memetik.com/audit)** to see exactly where you're missing citations in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. We'll show you competitor citations you're losing and outline the content infrastructure required to close your visibility gap.

## FAQ

**What's the difference between an SEO agency and an AEO agency?**
SEO agencies optimize for traditional search engine rankings, while AEO agencies optimize for citations in AI-generated responses from ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. AEO requires different content strategies, citation tracking tools, and measurement frameworks focused on LLM visibility.

**How long does it take to see results from AEO strategies?**
Most B2B companies see their first AI citations within 60-90 days of implementing comprehensive AEO strategies. Meaningful citation rate improvements (15%+ of target queries) typically appear within 4-6 months with proper content infrastructure and optimization.

**Do I need to stop SEO to focus on AEO?**
No, AEO complements traditional SEO rather than replacing it. The best approach integrates both: optimize for search engines while structuring content to maximize AI citation probability and LLM retrieval relevance.

**How much does a professional AEO agency cost?**
Mid-market B2B SaaS companies typically invest $10,000-25,000 monthly for comprehensive AEO services including citation tracking, programmatic content production, and multi-platform optimization. This is 30-50% higher than traditional SEO due to specialized expertise.

**What tools do AEO agencies use to track AI citations?**
Professional AEO agencies use proprietary citation monitoring systems that query AI platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini) daily with target keywords and log when client brands appear. No single third-party tool currently covers all platforms comprehensively.

**Can an AEO agency guarantee I'll rank #1 in ChatGPT?**
Legitimate agencies cannot guarantee specific "rankings" because AI responses vary by query phrasing, user context, and model version. Reputable agencies guarantee citation rates (% of queries where you're mentioned) or visibility improvements, not fixed positions.

**How many pages of content do I need for effective AEO?**
Research indicates brands with 300-500+ comprehensively optimized pages achieve citation rates above 15%, while those under 100 pages average 2-4% citation rates. Programmatic SEO approaches help scale to required volume efficiently.

**What metrics should I track to measure AEO success?**
Core AEO metrics include citation rate (% of target queries mentioning your brand), share of AI voice (your mentions vs. competitors), attribution quality (context of mentions), and platform coverage (how many AI assistants cite you). Traditional traffic and rankings remain secondary indicators.
