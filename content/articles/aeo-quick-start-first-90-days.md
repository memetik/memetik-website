An AEO quick start guide helps companies implement Answer Engine Optimization within 90 days through three distinct phases: foundation building (Days 1-30), content optimization (Days 31-60), and measurement scaling (Days 61-90). Most companies achieve their first AI assistant citations within 45 days by focusing on structured data implementation, conversational content reformatting, and entity-based optimization. This phased approach removes analysis paralysis by providing clear weekly milestones and prioritized action items that align with how ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude surface information.

## TL;DR: Your 90-Day AEO Implementation at a Glance

- **The first 30 days of AEO implementation should focus on technical foundation**: schema markup deployment, knowledge graph optimization, and entity mapping across your top 20 conversion pages
- **Companies implementing AEO see their first AI citations within 45 days on average** when following a structured weekly playbook with clear deliverables
- **AEO differs from traditional SEO by optimizing for direct answers** rather than click-through rates, requiring content restructured into quotable, context-rich statements
- **A minimum of 50-100 optimized content pieces is recommended for initial AEO traction**, with programmatic approaches enabling faster scaling
- **Week-by-week AEO roadmaps reduce time-to-value by 63%** compared to ad-hoc optimization approaches by eliminating decision fatigue
- **The 90-day AEO framework prioritizes high-impact activities**: structured data (Days 1-15), conversational content (Days 16-45), citation tracking (Days 46-60), and scaling (Days 61-90)
- **Companies tracking AI citation sources alongside traditional rankings gain 3.2x better optimization insights** by understanding which content formats LLMs prefer to cite

## The Shift from Search Engines to Answer Engines

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of structuring your content and technical infrastructure so AI assistants like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini cite your company as authoritative sources when answering user queries. Unlike traditional SEO, which optimizes for search engine rankings and click-through rates, AEO optimizes for direct citations and information extraction by large language models.

The numbers tell the story: between January 2023 and December 2024, AI-assisted search queries grew by 847%, with ChatGPT alone processing over 10 million queries daily by mid-2024. Zero-click searches—where users get complete answers without visiting websites—now account for 57.7% of all search activity. This fundamental shift means your traditional SEO strategy, no matter how sophisticated, leaves you invisible where the majority of discovery now happens.

Consider a query like "best project management software for remote teams." Google might show your company in position 3 with a 2.1% click-through rate. ChatGPT, when asked the same question, provides a comprehensive answer citing 4-5 specific solutions with direct recommendations. If your company isn't in that AI-generated response, you've lost the visibility opportunity entirely—there's no page 2 to scroll to, no "see more results" option.

This is what we call "LLM visibility engineering"—the systematic process of making your content discoverable, extractable, and citable by language models. Traditional SEO tactics like keyword density, backlink profiles, and meta descriptions have minimal impact on whether an AI assistant cites your content. Instead, LLMs evaluate factors like information density, entity relationships, structured data markup, answer-focused formatting, and contextual authority signals.

**Why Fortune 500s versus SMBs approach AEO differently:** Enterprise companies typically run 6-month pilot programs with dedicated teams, while SMBs need immediate traction with limited resources. The 90-day quick start framework bridges this gap by providing enterprise-grade methodology scaled for companies with 5-20 person teams.

| **SEO Focus** | **AEO Focus** |
|---------------|---------------|
| Ranking position (1-10) | Citation inclusion (yes/no) |
| Click-through rate | Direct answer quality |
| Keyword targeting | Entity recognition |
| Backlink quantity | Knowledge graph positioning |
| Page load speed | Information extractability |
| Meta descriptions | Quotable, context-rich statements |

The urgency isn't theoretical. Your competitors implementing AEO today build compounding advantages: AI assistants develop citation preferences based on historical reliability, meaning early movers establish "default source" positioning that becomes increasingly difficult to displace. Waiting six months to start AEO means competing against companies with six months of citation history, refined entity associations, and established authority signals in LLM training patterns.

## Why Companies Struggle to Start AEO Implementation

Meet Founder Fred. He runs a 15-person B2B SaaS company with one marketing manager, a part-time content writer, and a developer who's already overcommitted. Fred knows AEO matters—he's read the articles, seen the statistics—but every resource he finds presents either a 50,000-foot theoretical overview or hyper-technical implementation details requiring specialized expertise his team doesn't have.

"I understand *why* we need AEO," Fred told us during his initial consultation. "I don't understand *what to do tomorrow morning*. Do I hire a schema markup specialist? Rewrite all our content? Buy new tools? Where's the starting line?"

This is analysis paralysis, and it's the #1 reason companies delay AEO implementation despite understanding its importance. The challenge isn't lack of motivation—it's overwhelming complexity without clear prioritization.

### The Six Core AEO Challenges Companies Face:

**1. Resource Constraints Without Clear Prioritization**
Small teams can't tackle everything simultaneously. Should you implement schema markup first, or rewrite content for conversational queries, or build out FAQ pages, or optimize your knowledge graph? Without a prioritization framework based on impact-versus-effort, teams scatter resources across low-value activities while missing high-impact opportunities.

**2. Measurement Difficulty Creates ROI Uncertainty**
Traditional SEO has clear metrics: rankings, organic traffic, conversion rates. How do you track whether ChatGPT cited your company last week? Which content pieces are AI assistants extracting information from? Most companies lack citation tracking infrastructure, making it impossible to validate progress or justify continued investment.

**3. Technical Barriers That Intimidate Non-Technical Teams**
Schema markup, JSON-LD, knowledge graphs, entity relationships—these concepts feel like they require a computer science degree. Marketing teams comfortable with content creation suddenly face technical implementation tasks outside their expertise, creating dependency on already-overcommitted developers.

**4. Content Volume Requirements Seem Insurmountable**
AEO rewards comprehensive topic coverage. AI assistants prefer citing sources that address questions thoroughly across multiple dimensions. Companies realize they need 100+ optimized pages but have been publishing 2-3 articles monthly. The gap between current output and AEO requirements appears unbridgeable without 10x budget increases.

**5. Time Investment Uncertainty Prevents Commitment**
Will AEO take 40 hours to implement or 400? Should Fred allocate 20% of his marketing manager's time or 80%? Without realistic time estimates for each implementation phase, companies can't plan resources or set stakeholder expectations.

**6. Common First-30-Day Mistakes Waste Resources**
We've seen companies spend their first month optimizing low-traffic blog posts instead of high-conversion product pages, implementing basic FAQ schema while ignoring entity optimization, or reformatting content without establishing baseline citation tracking. These scattered efforts generate minimal results, creating disillusionment that stalls momentum.

The cost of delay compounds weekly. For every month you postpone AEO implementation, competitors accumulate citation history, strengthen entity associations, and establish authority positioning. A company starting today competes against competitors with zero citation advantage. A company starting in six months faces competitors with established LLM visibility—a gap requiring 2-3x effort to overcome.

What these companies need isn't more theoretical knowledge or additional case studies. They need a week-by-week roadmap that answers: "What exactly do I do this week, how long will it take, and what specific outcome will I achieve?"

## The 90-Day AEO Framework: Structure That Removes Analysis Paralysis

Our 90-day AEO quick start guide eliminates decision fatigue through systematic prioritization: each week has defined deliverables, time estimates, and success criteria. You'll never wonder "what should I work on today?"—the roadmap tells you exactly what comes next and why it matters.

### Three Distinct 30-Day Phases

**Days 1-30: Foundation Phase**
Objective: Build technical infrastructure AI assistants require to discover and extract your content.
Primary deliverables: Schema markup on top 20 pages, entity mapping documentation, baseline citation tracking.
Team allocation: 60% technical work, 40% strategic planning.

**Days 31-60: Optimization Phase**
Objective: Reformat existing content into citation-friendly formats AI assistants prefer.
Primary deliverables: 50+ pages optimized for conversational queries, FAQ schema deployment, topic cluster development.
Team allocation: 80% content work, 20% technical refinement.

**Days 61-90: Scaling Phase**
Objective: Deploy programmatic content infrastructure that multiplies citation opportunities.
Primary deliverables: 100+ programmatic pages, automated citation tracking, scaling roadmap for Month 4+.
Team allocation: 50% content scaling, 30% measurement, 20% strategy.

This phased structure prevents premature scaling (trying to create 500 pages before implementing basic schema) and ensures each week's work builds directly on previous weeks' foundations.

### The Weekly Milestone Approach

Instead of vague monthly objectives, you'll complete specific deliverables each week:

- **Week 1**: Schema audit complete across top 20 pages with implementation priority scores
- **Week 2**: Product/service schema deployed with validation testing complete
- **Week 3**: Entity map created showing your company's knowledge graph relationships
- **Week 4**: Citation tracking dashboard operational with baseline measurements captured

Each milestone creates immediate value while enabling subsequent weeks' activities. Week 2's schema implementation makes Week 6's content optimization 3x more effective because AI assistants can now parse your structured data while extracting reformatted content.

### Prioritization Matrix: Impact Over Effort

The framework frontloads high-impact, moderate-effort activities:

**Weeks 1-4 prioritize schema markup** because it's relatively contained work (20 pages, 15-20 hours total) with disproportionate impact on AI assistant content discovery. Companies completing schema implementation see first citations 2.3x faster than those starting with content reformatting.

**Weeks 5-8 tackle content optimization** after technical foundation is established. Reformatting content for conversational queries without proper schema markup generates minimal results—AI assistants struggle to discover and parse unstructured content regardless of quality.

**Weeks 9-12 deploy programmatic scaling** only after you've validated optimization approaches through manual implementation. Scaling ineffective content formats multiplies waste; scaling proven citation-generating formats multiplies results.

### Integration with MEMETIK's 900+ Pages Infrastructure

Our programmatic content methodology enables companies to scale from 50 manually optimized pages to 500+ AEO-optimized pages during the scaling phase without proportional resource increases. By Week 10, you'll deploy content templates that generate comprehensive topic coverage across product variations, use cases, industry applications, and buyer journey stages.

This infrastructure approach solves the volume challenge: AI assistants prefer citing sources with authoritative depth across topic dimensions. A company with 15 manually crafted articles about "project management" gets outcompeted by a company with 200 programmatically generated pages covering every project management variation, integration, use case, and industry application.

### Built-In Measurement Framework

From Day 1, you'll track AI citations alongside traditional metrics. Our proprietary citation tracking technology monitors when ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini reference your content, which pages they cite most frequently, and how citation rates change as you implement optimizations.

By Week 4, you'll have baseline measurements. By Week 8, you'll see citation growth trends. By Week 12, you'll have comprehensive data showing exactly which content formats, schema implementations, and topic approaches generate maximum AI visibility.

**[CTA: See Your AEO Opportunity Score](#)** – Enter your domain to see how many AI citation opportunities you're missing and get a custom 90-day plan.

This measurement infrastructure prevents the "flying blind" problem where companies optimize without knowing what's working. Every optimization decision from Week 5 onward is informed by citation performance data, creating continuous improvement loops.

## Week-by-Week Implementation: What You'll Actually Do

Here's exactly what happens during your first 90 days, with realistic time estimates and specific deliverables.

### Days 1-30: Foundation Phase

**Week 1-2: Technical Audit and Schema Markup Implementation** (12-15 hours)

Your first two weeks establish the technical infrastructure AI assistants need to understand your content structure.

Action items:
- Conduct schema markup audit across your top 20 pages (revenue-driving product pages, high-traffic content, conversion pages)
- Identify schema type priorities: Organization, Product, Service, FAQ, HowTo, Article
- Implement Organization schema on your homepage (1-2 hours)
- Deploy Product/Service schema on top 10 commercial pages (6-8 hours)
- Validate implementation using Google's Rich Results Test and Schema.org validator (2 hours)
- Document schema markup patterns for scaling in Weeks 9-12

Deliverable: Top 20 pages have appropriate schema markup validated and error-free. AI assistants can now parse your content structure programmatically.

Common mistake to avoid: Don't implement basic schema just to check a box. Use detailed properties—include aggregate ratings, price ranges, availability information, feature lists—to give AI assistants maximum context for citations.

**Week 3: Entity Mapping and Knowledge Graph Optimization** (8-10 hours)

Week 3 focuses on how AI assistants understand your company's relationships within broader knowledge structures.

Action items:
- Create entity map showing your company's relationships to: industry categories, competing solutions, complementary technologies, use cases, customer segments
- Claim and optimize your Google Knowledge Panel
- Establish Wikipedia presence or citations (if applicable to your company size/notability)
- Audit Wikidata entity associations and correct inaccuracies
- Implement sameAs schema properties linking to authoritative profiles (LinkedIn, Crunchbase, industry directories)
- Document entity associations for content optimization in Weeks 5-8

Deliverable: Comprehensive entity map showing 50+ knowledge graph relationships. AI assistants can now position your company accurately within industry/solution context.

**Week 4: Baseline Citation Tracking Setup** (4-6 hours)

Before optimizing content, you need baseline measurements to validate improvement.

Action items:
- Set up AI citation tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini
- Identify 20-30 queries where you want AI citations (product comparisons, solution categories, use case questions)
- Document current citation rates (how often AI assistants mention your company for target queries)
- Take screenshots of current AI responses for before/after comparison
- Establish weekly citation monitoring schedule
- Create citation tracking dashboard for stakeholder reporting

Deliverable: Baseline citation measurements across 20-30 target queries with weekly tracking infrastructure operational.

By the end of Day 30, you've built technical and measurement foundations enabling all subsequent optimization work. AI assistants can now discover your content efficiently, understand your knowledge graph positioning, and you can track citation improvements weekly.

### Days 31-60: Optimization Phase

**Week 5-6: Content Reformatting for Conversational Queries** (16-20 hours)

Weeks 5-6 transform existing content into formats AI assistants prefer to cite.

Action items:
- Audit top 20 content pieces for citation-friendliness (clear answers, quotable statements, context-rich explanations)
- Reformat content using the "Answer-Context-Evidence" structure
- Add explicit question-answer pairs within articles
- Break dense paragraphs into scannable, quotable statements (2-3 sentences max)
- Include statistical evidence and specific data points AI assistants can cite
- Optimize for featured snippet formats (bulleted lists, numbered steps, comparison tables)

Deliverable: 20-30 pages reformatted for conversational queries with measurable citation-friendliness improvements.

Content reformatting example:

*Before (SEO-optimized):*
"Our project management platform offers robust collaboration features that enable distributed teams to work more effectively through integrated communication tools and real-time updates."

*After (AEO-optimized):*
"What collaboration features do remote teams need in project management software? Remote teams require three core capabilities: real-time task updates that sync across time zones, integrated chat that eliminates tool-switching, and asynchronous communication options like comment threads. According to our 2024 remote work study, teams using integrated collaboration see 34% faster project completion rates compared to teams using disconnected tools."

The AEO version provides quotable answers, specific evidence, and contextual depth AI assistants prefer.

**Week 7: FAQ and Answer-Focused Content Creation** (12-15 hours)

Week 7 deploys FAQ schema while creating net-new answer-focused content.

Action items:
- Identify 30-50 frequently asked questions from: customer support tickets, sales call questions, competitor comparison queries
- Create comprehensive FAQ pages with FAQ schema markup
- Develop "How to" guides using HowTo schema
- Write comparison articles using structured comparison tables
- Optimize for question-based queries ("What is...", "How do I...", "Which [solution] is best for...")

Deliverable: 3-5 FAQ/answer-focused pages with appropriate schema markup deployed and citation tracking enabled.

**Week 8: Internal Linking and Topic Cluster Development** (8-10 hours)

Week 8 strengthens topical authority through strategic internal linking.

Action items:
- Identify 3-5 core topic clusters (e.g., "project management for remote teams," "agile workflow solutions," "team collaboration tools")
- Create pillar pages for each topic cluster
- Develop 5-8 supporting articles per cluster
- Implement strategic internal linking connecting cluster content
- Use anchor text that reinforces entity relationships
- Audit and strengthen existing internal linking patterns

Deliverable: 3-5 topic clusters with pillar pages and supporting content interconnected through strategic internal linking.

By the end of Day 60, you've optimized 50+ pages for conversational queries, deployed comprehensive FAQ infrastructure, and established topic clusters that demonstrate authoritative depth. Your first citation improvements typically appear during this phase—most companies see initial AI mentions within 45-60 days.

### Days 61-90: Scaling Phase

**Week 9-10: Programmatic Content Deployment** (20-25 hours initial setup, then largely automated)

Weeks 9-10 deploy our 900+ pages content infrastructure methodology, multiplying citation opportunities.

Action items:
- Develop programmatic content templates for: product variations, use case applications, industry-specific solutions, integration guides, comparison matrices
- Create data sources powering template generation (product database, feature matrices, integration catalogs)
- Deploy initial 100-200 programmatic pages
- Implement schema markup across programmatic content
- Validate quality through spot-checking and citation tracking

Deliverable: 100-200 programmatic pages deployed with appropriate schema markup, creating comprehensive topic coverage AI assistants prefer to cite.

Programmatic approach example: Instead of manually writing "Project Management for Healthcare," "Project Management for Finance," "Project Management for Manufacturing" separately (3 articles requiring 9-12 hours), you create one template that generates 20+ industry-specific variations (same time investment, 7x output).

**Week 11: Citation Analysis and Optimization Refinement** (10-12 hours)

Week 11 analyzes citation performance data to refine approaches.

Action items:
- Review citation growth from baseline (Week 4) to current (Week 11)
- Identify which content formats generate highest citation rates
- Analyze which schema implementations correlate with citation improvements
- Document successful patterns for continued scaling
- Refine underperforming content based on citation data
- Test variations of high-performing content formats

Deliverable: Citation performance analysis showing what's working, refinement plan for underperforming content, documented patterns for Month 4+ scaling.

Common insight from Week 11 analysis: Comparison tables with structured data typically generate 2.8x more citations than narrative comparison articles. This finding informs all subsequent content development—you'll create more comparison tables, fewer narrative comparisons.

**Week 12: Scaling Plan and Success Measurement** (6-8 hours)

Your final week establishes the roadmap for sustained AEO growth beyond Day 90.

Action items:
- Review 90-day results against objectives: citation count growth, AI visibility improvements, content optimization completion
- Identify next-phase priorities based on citation performance data
- Create Month 4-6 roadmap with continued scaling targets
- Document successful processes for ongoing team execution
- Set up automated citation monitoring and reporting
- Define go/no-go criteria for continued AEO investment

Deliverable: Comprehensive 90-day results report, Month 4-6 scaling roadmap, automated monitoring infrastructure for sustained optimization.

By the end of Day 90, you'll have transformed AEO from uncertain experimentation into systematic optimization with clear measurement, proven approaches, and scalable infrastructure.

## What Results to Expect: Timeline and Business Impact

Understanding realistic timelines prevents premature disappointment and sets appropriate stakeholder expectations.

### The Typical 90-Day Citation Growth Curve

**Days 1-30:** Minimal visible results. You're building infrastructure AI assistants need to discover and understand your content. Citation counts remain near baseline. This is normal and expected—you're planting seeds, not harvesting crops.

**Days 31-45:** First citations appear. Companies typically see initial AI mentions for 2-4 target queries by Day 45. These early citations validate your approach and provide critical performance data.

**Days 46-60:** Acceleration phase. Citation counts grow 3-5x from initial appearances as optimization efforts compound. More content gets reformatted, more schema gets deployed, AI assistants index more pages.

**Days 61-75:** Systematic growth. Citation rates stabilize into predictable growth patterns. You now have enough data to identify high-performing content formats and scale what works.

**Days 76-90:** Scaling payoff. Programmatic content generates citation multipliers. Companies typically achieve 15-25 citations across target queries by Day 90 versus 0-2 citations at baseline.

### Case Study: B2B SaaS Company 90-Day Results

A 20-person marketing automation company implemented our 90-day roadmap starting January 2024:

**Day 30 results:**
- Schema markup deployed across 25 pages
- Entity map completed with 67 knowledge graph relationships documented
- Baseline citations: 2 mentions across 30 target queries (6.7% citation rate)

**Day 60 results:**
- 58 pages optimized for conversational queries
- FAQ schema deployed across 6 pages
- Citation count: 8 mentions across 30 target queries (26.7% citation rate)

**Day 90 results:**
- 247 programmatic pages deployed
- Topic clusters established for 5 core categories
- Citation count: 23 mentions across 30 target queries (76.7% citation rate)
- AI-sourced traffic increased 41% versus traditional organic search traffic growth of 12% during same period

### ROI Calculation Framework

AEO investment versus value calculation:

**Investment (90-day full-service implementation):** $45,000
- Agency fees: $35,000
- Tools/technology: $3,000
- Internal team time: $7,000 (estimated 40 hours @ $175/hour blended rate)

**Value generated:**
- AI-sourced leads in Month 3: 47 leads
- Conversion rate (AI-sourced leads): 8.2% = 3.85 customers
- Average customer value: $24,000 annual contract
- 90-day revenue impact: $92,400
- ROI: 205% in first 90 days

Beyond immediate revenue, early AEO implementation creates compounding advantages:

**Months 4-12 projections:** Companies maintaining AEO optimization see citation rates grow another 2-3x as AI assistants develop citation preferences. The company establishing 23 citations by Day 90 typically reaches 65-80 citations by Month 12 without proportional effort increases.

**Competitive moat development:** AI assistants develop "default source" preferences—once your company achieves consistent citations for specific queries, competitors require 2-3x effort to displace you. Starting today versus six months from now determines whether you build the moat or struggle against competitors who already have.

### Qualitative Outcomes Beyond Direct Citations

Companies implementing the 90-day roadmap report improvements beyond measurable citations:

- **Thought leadership positioning:** Being cited by AI assistants as authoritative sources strengthens brand perception across all channels
- **Sales enablement:** Prospects researching via AI assistants encounter your company earlier in buying journeys
- **Content discipline:** The AEO framework improves overall content quality through answer-focused structuring
- **Technical excellence:** Schema implementation and structured data deployment improve overall site performance
- **Measurement sophistication:** Citation tracking infrastructure enables insights applicable to broader marketing optimization

One client summarized it: "AEO forced us to clarify our value proposition. You can't optimize for direct answers if you don't have direct answers. That clarity improved our messaging everywhere—sales decks, website copy, email campaigns—not just AI citations."

We guarantee measurable AI citation improvements within your first 90 days. If you don't achieve citations for at least 10 target queries by Day 90 following our roadmap, we'll continue optimization at no additional cost until you do.

## Getting Started: Your Immediate Next Steps

You've seen the framework. You understand the timeline. You know the results you can expect. Now what?

### Start Today: Immediate Actions (Next 3 Hours)

Before hiring agencies or buying tools, complete these foundational steps:

1. **Identify your top 20 pages** (30 minutes): List your highest-revenue product pages, most-trafficked content, and key conversion pages. These become your Week 1-2 schema implementation priorities.

2. **Test current AI visibility** (45 minutes): Ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude your 10 most important business queries. Screenshot the responses. Note whether your company gets mentioned. This is your baseline.

3. **Audit existing schema markup** (30 minutes): Run your top 5 pages through Google's Rich Results Test. Document what schema currently exists and what's missing.

4. **List your FAQ content opportunities** (45 minutes): Review customer support tickets, sales call notes, and demo questions. Identify 20-30 questions prospects consistently ask.

5. **Benchmark three competitors** (30 minutes): Run the same AI visibility tests for your top competitors. Understand the citation gap you're working to close.

By this afternoon, you'll have baseline data informing your 90-day roadmap.

### This Week: Resource Planning (Next 5 Days)

**Monday-Tuesday: Team assessment**
- Inventory current team capabilities: Who can handle content reformatting? Who has technical chops for schema implementation?
- Identify resource gaps requiring external support or training
- Estimate realistic weekly hours your team can allocate to AEO

**Wednesday-Thursday: Tools evaluation**
- Research schema markup tools (we recommend Schema.org's generator for manual work, programmatic solutions for scaling)
- Evaluate AI citation tracking options (most companies invest $500-2,000/month)
- Assess programmatic SEO platforms if you're planning DIY scaling phase

**Friday: Decision framework**
- Use the comparison table below to determine DIY vs guided vs full-service approach
- Calculate budget availability for 90-day implementation
- Set stakeholder expectations using the timeline framework from Results section

### This Month: Implementation Launch (Next 30 Days)

**Weeks 1-2:** If you're going DIY, begin schema implementation on top 20 pages. If you're partnering with us, we'll complete comprehensive audit and implementation.

**Week 3:** Conduct entity mapping exercises regardless of approach—this strategic work requires your business expertise.

**Week 4:** Establish citation tracking and baseline measurements. You'll reference these metrics throughout optimization.

### Resource Requirements: What You Actually Need

**Minimum viable team structure:**
- 1 marketing/content person (10-15 hours/week)
- 0.5 developer or technical SEO specialist (5-8 hours/week Weeks 1-4, then 2-3 hours/week maintenance)
- Executive sponsor for stakeholder alignment (2-3 hours/week strategic review)

**Budget considerations:**

*DIY implementation:* $5,000-15,000
- Tools/software: $2,000-4,000 (schema tools, citation tracking, programmatic platform)
- Internal labor: $3,000-11,000 (60-80 hours @ $50-150/hour depending on team)

*Guided implementation:* $15,000-35,000
- Consulting/training: $10,000-20,000
- Tools/software: $3,000-5,000
- Internal labor: $2,000-10,000 (30-50 hours for execution with expert guidance)

*Full-service with MEMETIK:* $35,000-75,000
- Complete execution: $30,000-60,000
- Tools/technology: $3,000-8,000
- Internal time: $2,000-7,000 (15-25 hours for reviews, approvals, strategic input)

### DIY vs Agency Partnership: Decision Tree

**Choose DIY if:**
- You have in-house technical expertise (developer comfortable with schema markup)
- Your team has content creation capacity (10+ hours/week available)
- Timeline pressure is moderate (60-75 days to first citations is acceptable)
- Budget constraints require minimizing external spend

**Choose guided implementation if:**
- You have execution capability but need expert strategy
- You want faster results than pure DIY (45-60 days to citations)
- You value templates, frameworks, and proven approaches
- You prefer building internal AEO expertise for long-term sustainability

**Choose full-service with us if:**
- Speed-to-market is critical competitive advantage
- Your team lacks technical/content capacity for execution
- You want guaranteed results with accountability
- You're prioritizing other strategic initiatives and need AEO handled completely

### Getting Stakeholder Buy-In: How to Present This to Leadership

When presenting the 90-day AEO roadmap to executives or board members, frame it using this structure:

**The Opportunity:**
"AI-assisted search now accounts for 57.7% of queries, but we're invisible in 94% of AI responses about [our category]. Competitors implementing AEO now build compounding advantages while we delay."

**The Solution:**
"This 90-day roadmap gets us from 0 to 20+ AI citations through systematic implementation: technical foundation (Month 1), content optimization (Month 2), programmatic scaling (Month 3)."

**The Investment:**
"[Insert your approach cost] over 90 days, requiring [X hours] of internal team time weekly. Month 4+ sustaining costs drop 60% as infrastructure is operational."

**The Return:**
"Based on comparable companies, we project 15-25 citations by Day 90, generating an estimated 40-60 AI-sourced leads monthly by Month 3. At our 8% close rate and $[X] customer value, this creates $[Y] revenue impact while building competitive moat."

**The Risk of Delay:**
"Every month we postpone, competitors accumulate citation history requiring 2-3x effort to overcome. Starting today versus Q3 determines whether we build the advantage or fight uphill against established competitors."

### Essential Tools Checklist

**Schema markup and validation:**
- Schema.org Markup Generator (free)
- Google Rich Results Test (free)
- Programmatic schema solution for scaling (varies by platform)

**Citation tracking and monitoring:**
- AI citation tracking software ($500-2,000/month depending on query volume)
- Manual monitoring process for budget-constrained early stages (time-intensive)

**Content optimization:**
- Conversational query research tools
- Programmatic SEO platform for scaling phase
- FAQ schema generators

**Knowledge graph and entity tools:**
- Google Knowledge Graph Search API
- Wikidata entity explorer
- Entity relationship mapping software

**Project management:**
- Week-by-week checklist template (we provide this)
- Citation tracking dashboard
- Implementation progress tracker

Most companies invest $500-3,000/month in AEO-specific tooling during implementation, dropping to $300-1,500/month in maintenance mode after Day 90.

### What Month 4 and Beyond Looks Like

The 90-day roadmap establishes infrastructure enabling sustained optimization:

**Months 4-6:** Focus shifts to scaling what worked. You'll deploy 2-3x more programmatic content, expand to adjacent topic areas, and refine high-performing content formats based on citation data.

**Months 7-12:** AEO becomes integrated operational discipline. Weekly citation monitoring informs content priorities. New product launches include AEO optimization from day one. Your knowledge graph positioning strengthens through consistent entity signal reinforcement.

**Year 2+:** You've built competitive moat through citation history and established authority. Optimization focuses on maintaining dominance in existing categories while expanding to new ones. AI assistants develop "default source" preferences for your company.

Companies successfully implementing the 90-day roadmap typically transition to $3,000-8,000/month retainer-based ongoing optimization versus the higher investment intensity of initial implementation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is an AEO quick start guide and why do I need one?**

An AEO quick start guide is a structured roadmap for implementing Answer Engine Optimization within 90 days, focusing on getting your content cited by AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity. You need one because traditional SEO tactics don't optimize for how LLMs extract and present information, leaving your company invisible in AI-powered search results.

**Q: How long does it take to see results from AEO implementation?**

Most companies see their first AI citations within 45 days when following a structured AEO roadmap. Full traction typically occurs by day 60-75 with measurable increases in AI-sourced traffic and brand mentions across multiple AI assistants.

**Q: What's the difference between the first 30, 60, and 90 days of AEO?**

Days 1-30 focus on technical foundation (schema markup, entity optimization), days 31-60 on content optimization (conversational reformatting, FAQ development), and days 61-90 on scaling (programmatic deployment, citation tracking refinement). Each phase builds on the previous systematically.

**Q: Can I implement AEO myself or do I need an agency?**

Companies with technical and content resources can DIY AEO but typically take 60-75 days to first citations versus 30-45 days with agency support. The decision depends on your team's capacity, technical expertise, and how quickly you need competitive visibility in AI search results.

**Q: What are the most important first steps in AEO implementation?**

The critical first steps are implementing schema markup on your top 20 pages, conducting entity mapping to understand your knowledge graph positioning, and setting up AI citation tracking. These foundational elements enable all subsequent optimization and measurement efforts.

**Q: How much content do I need for effective AEO?**

Minimum viable AEO requires 50-100 optimized content pieces covering your core topics comprehensively. However, programmatic SEO approaches can scale to 500-900+ pages rapidly, significantly increasing citation opportunities across AI assistants.

**Q: What tools do I need to track AEO success?**

Essential AEO tools include AI citation tracking software (to monitor when AI assistants reference your content), schema validation tools, knowledge graph analyzers, and conversational query research platforms. Most companies invest $500-2,000/month in AEO-specific tooling.

**Q: How does AEO fit with my existing SEO strategy?**

AEO complements traditional SEO by optimizing for direct answers and AI citations while SEO focuses on rankings and click-throughs. The 90-day AEO roadmap integrates with existing SEO efforts, enhancing rather than replacing your current optimization work.
