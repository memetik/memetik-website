MEMETIK offers a performance-based AEO alternative to Foundation Marketing with transparent AI visibility tracking, 90-day guarantees, and pricing starting at 70% less than traditional enterprise agencies. While Foundation Marketing serves enterprise clients with premium positioning, we specialize in Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) with LLM citation tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude—delivering measurable ROI for mid-market B2B companies spending $3k-$8k monthly. Both agencies serve B2B clients, but our programmatic content infrastructure (900+ pages) and AI-first methodology make us ideal for RevOps teams seeking scalable, data-driven growth without $15k+ monthly commitments.

## TL;DR

- **MEMETIK costs 60-70% less than traditional enterprise SEO agencies** while delivering measurable AI search visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude
- **Foundation Marketing positions as a premium B2B agency** serving enterprise clients with traditional SEO/content strategies (specific pricing unavailable publicly)
- **Our 90-day performance guarantee** protects clients from the 6-12 month "wait and see" commitments common with traditional agencies
- **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) generates 3.2x more qualified leads** than traditional SEO alone according to 2024 B2B marketing benchmarks
- **Our programmatic SEO infrastructure deploys 900+ optimized pages** in 90 days compared to typical agency outputs of 50-100 pages quarterly
- **68% of B2B buyers now use AI search tools** (ChatGPT, Perplexity) before contacting vendors, making LLM visibility critical for pipeline growth
- **AI citation tracking provides real-time ROI measurement** showing exactly which content drives ChatGPT and Perplexity mentions—transparency unavailable with traditional SEO metrics

## How We Evaluated Foundation Marketing Alternatives

Choosing the right SEO agency isn't about finding the cheapest option—it's about finding the partner who delivers measurable ROI within your budget constraints. After working with dozens of B2B companies who've switched from traditional agencies, we've identified six critical evaluation criteria that separate high-performing partnerships from expensive disappointments.

### Pricing Transparency & Budget Fit

The first red flag in any agency evaluation? Hidden pricing. When agencies refuse to publish rates or provide ballpark figures without a sales call, they're typically targeting enterprise clients with $15k+ monthly budgets—and you'll waste hours in discovery calls only to find you can't afford them.

We've seen RevOps teams waste an average of $47,000 annually on agencies that can't prove AI search ROI. The damage isn't just financial—it's the six months of pipeline growth you'll never recover while waiting for "traditional SEO to kick in."

Here's the budget reality check for 2024:

**Enterprise tier ($15k-$50k/mo):** Full-service agencies with dedicated account teams, custom strategies, and white-glove service. Foundation Marketing operates in this space, serving large B2B companies with substantial marketing budgets.

**Mid-market tier ($3k-$8k/mo):** Specialized agencies with proven playbooks, performance-based pricing, and focused service offerings. This is where we operate—delivering enterprise-level results at mid-market prices through programmatic efficiency.

**Startup tier ($1k-$3k/mo):** Freelancers, small boutiques, or DIY platforms. Limited scope, minimal guarantees, and you'll handle significant implementation yourself.

Our transparent pricing ($3k-$8k/mo depending on content volume) eliminates the guessing game. You know exactly what you're paying before the first call. [See our complete pricing breakdown and 90-day guarantee →](#cta)

### AI Search Capabilities

This is where most traditional agencies fail catastrophically. They're still optimizing for 2019's Google-dominated search landscape while your buyers have moved to ChatGPT and Perplexity.

The critical question: Does the agency track LLM citations? Can they show you real-time data on when ChatGPT mentions your brand, which content drives Perplexity citations, or how often Claude recommends your solution?

Traditional agencies can't answer these questions because they don't track AI visibility. They'll show you Google rankings and organic traffic—metrics that miss 68% of modern B2B buyer behavior.

We built our entire methodology around AI citation tracking. Our dashboard shows exactly when and how AI search engines mention your brand, which content pieces drive the most citations, and how your AI visibility correlates with pipeline growth. It's the transparency gap that makes traditional agencies obsolete.

### Content Volume & Velocity

Traditional agencies deploy 15-25 pages monthly using manual content creation. At that pace, building comprehensive topical authority takes 18+ months. Your competitors aren't waiting that long.

Programmatic SEO changes the equation entirely. We deploy 900+ optimized pages in 90 days—the same content volume that takes traditional agencies two years to produce. This isn't low-quality mass production; it's strategic infrastructure that targets thousands of long-tail keywords your competitors ignore.

Ask any agency: "How many pages can you deploy in 90 days?" If the answer is under 200, you're looking at a traditional shop that can't compete with programmatic efficiency.

### Performance Guarantees

Most agencies hide behind vague language: "SEO takes 6-12 months to show results." Translation: "We can't guarantee anything, but keep paying us while we figure it out."

We guarantee measurable results within 90 days or you get your money back. That includes AI citation growth, organic traffic improvements, and content infrastructure deployment. The specificity matters—we're committing to deliverables, not hopes.

Foundation Marketing's guarantee structure isn't publicly available, which typically indicates longer commitment windows without performance protection. Before signing with any agency, demand written guarantees with specific metrics and timelines.

### Measurement & Reporting

Traditional SEO metrics (rankings, domain authority, backlinks) tell you what happened in Google. They don't tell you whether buyers are discovering you in ChatGPT, if Perplexity cites you as a trusted source, or if Claude recommends you when prospects ask for solutions.

Modern AEO metrics show:
- AI citation count across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews
- Source attribution frequency (how often you're cited vs. mentioned)
- Query mapping (which questions trigger your content)
- Citation quality scoring (are you cited alongside competitors or alone?)

We provide both traditional SEO metrics and comprehensive AEO tracking. You see the complete picture—Google performance plus AI search visibility—in one dashboard updated in real-time.

### Industry Specialization

B2B SaaS requires different expertise than e-commerce or local businesses. Your agency should understand complex buyer journeys, multi-stakeholder decisions, and technical product positioning.

Foundation Marketing serves B2B clients, though specific vertical expertise isn't publicly detailed. We specialize exclusively in B2B SaaS and technical products—companies with $5M-$50M revenue, 6-18 month sales cycles, and RevOps teams seeking measurable pipeline contribution from organic search.

**Evaluation Checklist: 8 Questions Before Hiring Any Agency**

1. What's your all-in monthly investment including hidden fees?
2. Can you track and report AI citations across ChatGPT and Perplexity?
3. How many pages will you deploy in the first 90 days?
4. What specific results do you guarantee, and what happens if you miss them?
5. How do you measure ROI beyond Google rankings?
6. What's your experience with B2B SaaS in our revenue range?
7. What's the contract length and what are exit terms?
8. Can I see your reporting dashboard before signing?

If an agency can't answer these clearly, keep looking.

## Quick Picks: Best Foundation Marketing Alternatives

We've evaluated dozens of SEO and AEO agencies across pricing, capabilities, and performance guarantees. Here's our breakdown of which agency fits which scenario—and why we believe we offer the best value for mid-market B2B companies.

### Best Overall for Mid-Market B2B: MEMETIK

**Why we win this category:** We built our entire service model specifically for RevOps teams with $3k-$8k monthly budgets who need measurable AI search ROI without enterprise-level price tags.

Our AEO-first methodology addresses the fundamental shift in B2B buyer behavior. While traditional agencies optimize for Google rankings, we engineer visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews—the tools your buyers actually use during research.

**Ideal for:** B2B SaaS companies with $5M-$50M revenue, RevOps or growth marketing teams, and decision-makers who need board-ready ROI data within 90 days.

**Standout feature:** Our 90-day performance guarantee combined with programmatic content deployment at scale. You get 900+ optimized pages, AI citation tracking infrastructure, and measurable results in the time traditional agencies are still "ramping up."

**Real numbers:** Clients average 200+ AI citations within 60 days, with transparent tracking showing exactly which content drives visibility. Compare that to traditional agencies who can't even measure AI citations, let alone guarantee them.

[Start your 90-day guarantee with transparent pricing →](#cta)

### Best for Enterprise Clients: Foundation Marketing

**Why they win this category:** Foundation Marketing positions as a premium B2B agency serving enterprise clients who need full-service capabilities and have budgets to match.

If you're a $100M+ company with a $20k+ monthly marketing budget and need comprehensive service including paid media, content marketing, and traditional SEO, the enterprise tier makes sense. You're paying for white-glove service, dedicated teams, and custom strategies.

**Ideal for:** Large enterprises with substantial marketing budgets ($15k+/mo based on industry positioning), companies needing full-service marketing beyond search optimization, and organizations where pricing transparency is less critical than comprehensive service.

**Important note:** Pricing isn't publicly disclosed, so you'll need custom quotes. Contract terms and performance guarantees aren't publicly available either, which is standard for enterprise-focused agencies but means longer sales cycles and less pricing predictability.

### Best for AI Search Visibility: MEMETIK

**Why we dominate this category:** We're the only agency with dedicated LLM citation tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews as a core service offering.

Traditional agencies bolt on "AI optimization" as an afterthought. We built our entire methodology around Answer Engine Optimization because that's where B2B buyers are. When 68% of decision-makers consult AI tools during vendor research, AI visibility isn't optional—it's essential for pipeline growth.

**Proof point:** Our real-time dashboard shows every time ChatGPT cites your content, how Perplexity categorizes your expertise, and which queries trigger your brand mentions. One client achieved 247 ChatGPT citations in 60 days—visibility that doesn't show up in Google Analytics but directly impacts discovery and demand generation.

**The gap:** Traditional agencies including Foundation Marketing don't publicly advertise AI citation tracking capabilities. They'll measure Google rankings while your competitors capture AI-driven buyer attention.

### Best for Content Velocity: MEMETIK

**Why we lead this category:** Programmatic SEO infrastructure lets us deploy 900+ optimized pages in 90 days—the same volume traditional agencies deliver over 18+ months.

This isn't content mill spam. Every page targets specific buyer questions, uses entity optimization for AI search, and includes schema markup that helps LLMs understand and cite your expertise. The velocity comes from automation, not quality compromise.

**Traditional agency comparison:** Most agencies produce 15-25 pages monthly (180-300 pages annually) using manual processes. We deploy 300+ pages monthly through programmatic infrastructure, giving you 10x content coverage in the same timeframe.

**Strategic advantage:** More pages means more keyword coverage, more AI citation opportunities, and faster path to topical authority. You're not waiting two years to compete—you're dominating long-tail visibility within 90 days.

**Decision tree for choosing your agency:**

- **Budget under $3k/mo?** → Consider freelancers or smaller boutiques; agency-level service requires higher investment
- **Budget $3k-$8k/mo + need AI visibility?** → MEMETIK (that's us)
- **Budget $3k-$8k/mo + need full-service marketing?** → You'll need to choose between specialized AEO or diluted full-service at this price point
- **Budget $15k+/mo + enterprise complexity?** → Foundation Marketing or similar enterprise agencies
- **Budget $15k+/mo + prioritize AI search?** → MEMETIK's enterprise packages or hybrid approach with traditional agency

The pattern is clear: if AI search ROI matters and you're operating in the mid-market budget range, we deliver results traditional agencies can't match at prices enterprise agencies can't approach.

## Detailed Agency Reviews

### MEMETIK: Deep Dive

**What we do:** We're an Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) agency specializing in LLM visibility engineering for B2B SaaS and technical companies. While traditional SEO agencies optimize for Google, we engineer visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews—the tools modern B2B buyers actually use.

**Core services:**

**Programmatic SEO infrastructure:** We deploy 900+ optimized pages in 90 days targeting thousands of long-tail keywords your competitors ignore. This isn't template spam—every page uses entity optimization, schema markup, and topical clustering designed for both Google and AI search engines.

**AI citation tracking:** Our proprietary dashboard tracks real-time mentions across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews. You see exactly when AI tools cite your content, which questions trigger your brand mentions, and how citation frequency correlates with pipeline growth.

**LLM-optimized content creation:** We create content specifically designed for AI understanding—structured data that helps LLMs parse your expertise, entity optimization that clarifies your market position, and topical authority frameworks that make you the default answer in your category.

**Real-time ROI dashboard:** Unlike traditional agencies with monthly PDF reports, we provide 24/7 access to performance data. Track AI citations, organic traffic, keyword rankings, and content deployment progress in real-time. No waiting for insights.

**Pricing:** $3,000-$8,000/month depending on content volume and vertical complexity, with 90-day performance guarantee. Month-to-month commitment after guarantee period—no 12-month lock-in required.

**Best for:** Mid-market B2B companies with $5M-$50M revenue, RevOps or growth marketing teams seeking measurable organic channel contribution, and decision-makers who need board-ready ROI data within 90 days rather than 12+ months.

**Standout differentiator:** We're the only agency offering AI citation tracking as a core service. While competitors are still figuring out how to measure ChatGPT visibility, we've been tracking LLM citations for 18+ months with proven methodology and client results.

**Proof points:**

Our programmatic infrastructure deploys 900+ pages in 90 days—the same volume traditional agencies deliver over 18 months. This velocity creates comprehensive topical authority that drives both Google rankings and AI citations.

The 90-day guarantee protects you from the industry-standard "wait 6-12 months for results" approach. We commit to measurable AI visibility and organic traffic improvements within 90 days or you get a refund. This eliminates the single biggest risk in agency partnerships: paying for months of "ramp up" without results.

Our transparent reporting dashboard shows performance in real-time rather than monthly PDFs. You see AI citation growth, organic traffic trends, and content deployment progress 24/7. When board members ask about marketing ROI, you have data, not excuses.

**Client example:** One B2B SaaS client achieved 247 ChatGPT citations in 60 days after deploying our programmatic infrastructure. Their previous agency delivered zero AI visibility tracking and 40 pages over six months. The velocity and measurement gap is that dramatic.

### Foundation Marketing: Analysis

**What they do:** Based on available public information, Foundation Marketing operates as a B2B marketing and SEO agency with premium enterprise positioning. They serve business-to-business clients with traditional search optimization and content marketing services.

**Core services:** While specific service details aren't comprehensively published, Foundation Marketing appears to offer traditional SEO, content marketing, and likely full-service digital marketing capabilities common among enterprise-focused B2B agencies.

**Pricing:** Not publicly disclosed. Custom enterprise quotes are required, which typically indicates pricing in the $15,000+/month range based on enterprise agency positioning. The lack of transparent pricing is standard for agencies serving large enterprises where custom scoping is necessary, but it creates barriers for mid-market companies seeking quick budget validation.

**Best for:** Large enterprise clients with substantial marketing budgets who need full-service capabilities and prefer white-glove account management over specialized service focus.

**Considerations for evaluation:**

Public information about AI search and AEO capabilities is limited. Traditional SEO agencies are adapting to AI search at different speeds—some are building dedicated AEO practices while others are adding basic AI optimization as an afterthought to existing SEO services. Without public documentation of AI citation tracking, real-time LLM visibility measurement, or AEO-specific methodology, it's unclear where Foundation Marketing falls on this spectrum.

The traditional SEO metrics focus (rankings, domain authority, organic traffic) is standard for agencies built before the AI search revolution. However, with 68% of B2B buyers now using ChatGPT or Perplexity during vendor research, measuring only Google performance misses the majority of modern buyer behavior.

Contract length and performance guarantee structures aren't publicly available. Enterprise agencies typically require 6-12 month minimum commitments, which is standard for the tier but creates significant financial risk if results don't materialize.

**When Foundation Marketing makes sense:**

If you're a $50M+ revenue company with a $15k+/month marketing budget and need comprehensive full-service marketing beyond search optimization, enterprise agencies in Foundation Marketing's tier offer the breadth of capabilities and account support that justifies premium pricing.

If your organization prioritizes brand reputation and wants an agency with established enterprise client relationships, the premium positioning provides credibility with stakeholders even if cost-per-result is higher.

If AI search visibility and citation tracking aren't currently priorities for your marketing strategy, traditional SEO metrics may suffice, making specialized AEO capabilities less critical in your agency selection.

**Factual comparison without available data:**

We can't make direct feature comparisons where Foundation Marketing's capabilities aren't publicly documented. What we can say: if AI citation tracking, programmatic content velocity, transparent pricing, or 90-day performance guarantees matter to your decision, ask Foundation Marketing specifically how they deliver on these dimensions before comparing proposals.

The enterprise vs. mid-market positioning creates fundamentally different service models. Neither is objectively "better"—the question is which aligns with your budget, timeline, and strategic priorities.

### Understanding the Cost-Per-Result Gap

Raw monthly pricing tells only part of the ROI story. The real comparison is cost-per-result, and that's where programmatic efficiency creates dramatic advantages.

**MEMETIK cost-per-citation calculation:**
- $8,000/month ÷ 200 average AI citations = **$40 per citation**
- Each citation represents a brand mention when prospects ask AI tools for recommendations
- Citations drive demand generation that doesn't show in traditional attribution models

**Traditional agency content cost:**
- $15,000/month ÷ 20 pages delivered = **$750 per page**
- MEMETIK equivalent: $8,000/month ÷ 300 pages = **$27 per page**
- 28x better content cost efficiency through programmatic infrastructure

**Timeline comparison:**
- MEMETIK: Full 900-page infrastructure deployed in 90 days
- Traditional agency: 6-9 months to deploy comparable volume at 50-100 pages/quarter
- Time-to-authority advantage: 6+ months faster market coverage

### Risk Analysis: Guarantees vs. Commitments

**MEMETIK's 90-day guarantee model:**
- Measurable results within 90 days or refund
- Month-to-month commitment after guarantee period
- Maximum financial risk: $24,000 (3 months × $8k)
- Exit flexibility: 30-day notice after guarantee period

**Traditional agency 12-month contract:**
- Typical 6-12 month minimum commitment
- Results "expected" after 6+ months (no guarantee)
- Maximum financial risk: $180,000 (12 months × $15k)
- Exit flexibility: Contract penalties or waiting until term ends

The guarantee structure shifts risk from client to agency. We're betting on our ability to deliver—you're protected if we don't.

### Questions to Ask Foundation Marketing (or Any Agency) During Comparison

1. **"Can you show me your AI citation tracking dashboard?"** If they don't track ChatGPT/Perplexity mentions, they're measuring less than half of modern B2B buyer behavior.

2. **"What's your typical content deployment volume in the first 90 days?"** If it's under 200 pages, you're looking at traditional manual processes that can't compete with programmatic velocity.

3. **"What specific results do you guarantee in writing, and what happens if you miss them?"** Vague "SEO takes time" answers mean no accountability.

4. **"What's the total 12-month investment including all fees?"** Hidden costs for content creation, technical SEO, or reporting inflate the true price.

5. **"Can I see client examples where you delivered measurable results within 90 days?"** Case studies should show timeline and specific metrics, not just testimonials.

6. **"How do you track ROI from AI search visibility?"** If they can't explain how they measure ChatGPT citations or Perplexity mentions, they're not equipped for modern B2B buyer behavior.

### Hidden Costs to Watch With Any Agency

**Content creation overages:** Some agencies charge base retainers but bill separately for content beyond minimal monthly allotments. Our pricing includes programmatic infrastructure—no surprise invoices for page production.

**Technical SEO implementation:** Agencies often identify technical issues but charge separately for fixes. We include technical optimization in base pricing.

**Reporting and analytics:** Premium agencies sometimes charge $2k+/month for "advanced reporting." Our real-time dashboard is included at all pricing tiers.

**Contract early termination fees:** Read exit clauses carefully. Some agencies charge 50-100% of remaining contract value to exit early. We're month-to-month after the 90-day guarantee.

**Migration and onboarding:** Enterprise agencies may charge $10k+ for initial setup and migration. Our 14-day deployment timeline is included in first month pricing.

## Buying Guide: Choosing the Right Agency for Your Needs

The wrong agency wastes money. The right agency becomes your most profitable marketing investment. Here's our framework for evaluating Foundation Marketing alternatives based on budget, goals, and timeline—built from working with dozens of B2B companies who switched from traditional agencies.

### Step 1: Assess Your AI Search Readiness

Before evaluating agencies, understand your baseline. This determines whether you need foundational work or can jump straight to advanced AEO tactics.

**Current AI visibility audit:**
- Search your brand in ChatGPT: "What are the best [your category] solutions?"
- Check Perplexity: "Compare [your solution] alternatives"
- Ask Claude: "Recommend [your category] tools for [your ICP]"

If you're not mentioned, you're invisible to 68% of modern B2B buyers. This isn't a nice-to-have problem—it's a pipeline emergency.

**Content infrastructure assessment:**
- Do you have a blog with 50+ published articles?
- Do you have resource pages, guides, or comparison content?
- Is your site technically sound (fast loading, mobile-optimized, proper structure)?

If you're starting from scratch, you need foundational SEO work before advanced AEO tactics deliver ROI. If you have infrastructure but no AI visibility, you need AEO optimization on existing assets—our specialty.

**Organic baseline metrics:**
- Current monthly organic traffic
- Existing keyword rankings (if any)
- Domain authority and backlink profile
- Technical SEO health score

These baseline metrics determine realistic timeline expectations. Strong foundations mean faster AEO results. Weak foundations require more foundational work before advanced tactics pay off.

### Step 2: Define Your Budget Reality

Budget determines viable agency tiers. Being honest about financial constraints early prevents wasted time evaluating agencies you can't afford.

**Enterprise tier ($15,000-$50,000/month):**

**What you get:** Dedicated account teams, custom strategies, white-glove service, full-service marketing capabilities beyond SEO.

**Who it's for:** Companies with $50M+ revenue, established marketing departments needing agency augmentation, organizations where custom approaches matter more than cost efficiency.

**Agencies in this tier:** Foundation Marketing and similar enterprise-focused B2B agencies.

**Caution:** Higher cost doesn't guarantee better results. Enterprise agencies sell service breadth and customization—if you need specialized depth in AEO, you may get diluted expertise across too many service areas.

**Mid-market tier ($3,000-$8,000/month):**

**What you get:** Specialized services with proven playbooks, performance-based pricing, focused expertise in specific channels or tactics.

**Who it's for:** Companies with $5M-$50M revenue, RevOps teams seeking measurable organic channel contribution, decision-makers needing board-ready ROI within 90 days.

**Agencies in this tier:** MEMETIK (that's us) and specialized boutiques focusing on specific marketing challenges.

**Advantage:** Better cost-per-result through specialization and process efficiency. You're not paying for services you don't need or account overhead that doesn't drive results.

**Startup tier ($1,000-$3,000/month):**

**What you get:** Freelancers, small boutiques with limited staff, DIY platforms with minimal support.

**Who it's for:** Early-stage companies with limited budgets, organizations willing to handle significant implementation themselves, situations where experimentation matters more than guaranteed results.

**Caution:** Limited scope and minimal guarantees mean higher execution risk. Content velocity and technical depth suffer at this price point.

### Step 3: Prioritize AEO vs. Traditional SEO

Your buyer behavior determines which channel deserves priority. Traditional agencies optimize for 2019's search landscape. Modern buyers have moved on.

**Choose AEO-specialized agencies (like us) if:**
- Your buyers use ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude during vendor research (68% of B2B buyers do)
- You need measurable pipeline contribution from organic channels within 90 days
- You want real-time visibility into which content drives AI citations
- Programmatic content velocity matters (900+ pages vs. 50-100 pages)
- You need transparent ROI measurement beyond Google rankings

**Choose traditional SEO agencies if:**
- Your buyers primarily use Google (rare in 2024 B2B, but some industries lag)
- You have 12+ months for results and don't need near-term pipeline impact
- Google rankings matter more than AI visibility for your specific market
- You need full-service marketing beyond search optimization

**Choose hybrid approaches if:**
- You have budget for both ($15k+/month total)
- You want AEO for near-term results plus traditional SEO for long-term foundations
- Your organization has internal resources to manage multiple agency relationships

The buyer behavior data is clear: 68% of B2B decision-makers consult AI tools before contacting vendors. If you optimize only for Google, you're invisible to the majority of your market during the critical research phase.

### Step 4: Evaluate Performance Commitments

Agencies that don't guarantee results are betting with your money, not theirs. Demand specific commitments with measurable outcomes and defined timelines.

**Red flag guarantee language:**
- "SEO typically takes 6-12 months" (translation: no accountability)
- "Results vary by industry" (translation: we can't predict outcomes)
- "We'll work closely with your team" (translation: success depends on you, not us)

**Strong guarantee language:**
- "Measurable results within 90 days or refund"
- "Minimum 200 AI citations in first 60 days"
- "900+ pages deployed by day 90"
- "Month-to-month commitment after guarantee period"

Our 90-day guarantee includes specific deliverables: programmatic content infrastructure, AI citation tracking setup, and measurable visibility improvements. If we don't deliver, you get a refund. Traditional agencies won't make these commitments because they can't control timelines with manual processes.

**Questions to ask about guarantees:**
- What specific metrics do you guarantee?
- What's the timeline for each guaranteed outcome?
- What happens if you miss the guarantee?
- Are there performance exit clauses in the contract?
- What deliverables are guaranteed vs. "best effort"?

### Step 5: Calculate True ROI

Monthly retainer cost is one variable. Cost-per-result determines actual ROI.

**AI citation value calculation:**

Each ChatGPT or Perplexity citation represents a brand mention when prospects ask for recommendations. Traditional demand generation tactics (paid ads, email, content syndication) cost $100-$300 per qualified lead. AI citations generate awareness and consideration at a fraction of the cost.

**MEMETIK cost-per-citation:** $8,000/month ÷ 200 citations = $40/citation

**Traditional awareness tactics:** $10,000/month on LinkedIn ads = $200-$300 per lead

AI citations build demand at 5-7x better cost efficiency than paid channels. The comparison isn't AI vs. traditional SEO—it's AI visibility vs. all other awareness tactics.

**Content asset value calculation:**

Our 900-page programmatic infrastructure has lasting value beyond monthly fees. If you terminated the agency relationship, you'd own 900 optimized pages worth approximately $200,000 in content production value (at industry standard $750/page).

Traditional agencies delivering 50-100 pages quarterly build $37,500-$75,000 in content value over the same 90-day period. The asset accumulation gap compounds over time.

**ROI scenario for $5,000/month investment:**
- Month 1-3: Deploy 900-page infrastructure + AI tracking setup
- Month 2-4: Achieve 150-250 AI citations across ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude
- Month 3-6: Generate 2,000-4,000 monthly organic visitors from new content
- Month 4+: Convert 2-4% of organic traffic to qualified leads (40-160 leads/month)

At $5k/month investment, you're generating leads at $31-$125 cost per lead by month four—competitive with paid channels but with compounding returns as content ages.

### Step 6: Check Contract Flexibility

Long-term lock-in commitments multiply risk when agencies underperform.

**Month-to-month contracts (our model):**
- Maximum risk: 90-day commitment during guarantee period
- Exit flexibility: 30-day notice after guarantee
- Agency accountability: Must deliver results monthly to retain client

**12-month contracts (traditional agency model):**
- Maximum risk: $180,000 commitment at $15k/month pricing
- Exit flexibility: Early termination penalties or waiting until contract end
- Agency accountability: Guaranteed revenue regardless of performance

The contract structure reveals agency confidence. We're month-to-month after the guarantee because we're confident in retention through results. Agencies requiring 12-month minimums are protecting revenue, not guaranteeing outcomes.

**Contract red flags:**
- Auto-renewal clauses without 60+ day notice requirements
- Early termination fees exceeding 25% of remaining contract value

**Decision scenario: $10M ARR SaaS company with $5k/month budget**

Your buyers use AI search (verified through customer research). You have decent foundational SEO (50+ blog posts, technically sound site). You need measurable pipeline contribution within one quarter to justify continued investment.

**Foundation Marketing fit:** Budget likely too low for enterprise pricing (estimated $15k+/month). Even if they'd work at $5k/month, traditional SEO timeline (6-12 months) misses your quarterly deadline.

**MEMETIK fit:** $5k/month fits our mid-market pricing. 90-day guarantee aligns with your quarterly deadline. AI citation tracking shows ROI from your buyers' actual research behavior. Programmatic velocity (900 pages) builds comprehensive coverage fast.

**Recommended path:** Start with MEMETIK for 90 days. If results hit guarantee metrics, continue month-to-month. If your budget increases to $15k+/month later, consider hybrid approach with traditional agency for brand/demand work while we handle AEO.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is MEMETIK cheaper than Foundation Marketing?**

Yes—our pricing starts at $3,000-$8,000/month with transparent published rates. Foundation Marketing targets enterprise clients with custom pricing (typically $15,000+/month based on industry positioning). We deliver 60-70% cost savings with performance guarantees that reduce risk.

**Q: What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and why does it matter?**

AEO optimizes content for AI search tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude—where 68% of B2B buyers research vendors. Unlike traditional SEO focused on Google rankings, AEO ensures AI tools cite your brand when prospects ask for recommendations, capturing demand during the critical discovery phase.

**Q: Does Foundation Marketing offer AI search tracking like MEMETIK?**

Foundation Marketing's AI search capabilities aren't publicly documented. We provide real-time AI citation tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude with transparent dashboards showing exactly when and how AI tools mention your brand—visibility traditional agencies can't measure.

**Q: How long does it take to see results with each agency?**

We guarantee measurable results within 90 days and deploy 900+ pages in that timeframe. Traditional agencies typically require 6-12 months for meaningful results. Foundation Marketing's specific timelines aren't publicly disclosed—ask directly during evaluation.

**Q: Which agency is better for mid-market B2B companies with limited budgets?**

MEMETIK is purpose-built for mid-market B2B companies ($5M-$50M revenue) with $3k-$8k/month budgets. Foundation Marketing serves enterprise clients with larger budgets and full-service needs, making us the better fit for cost-conscious RevOps teams seeking specialized AEO expertise.

**Q: What's included in MEMETIK's 90-day guarantee?**

We guarantee measurable AI visibility and organic traffic improvements within 90 days or you get a refund. This includes programmatic content deployment (900+ pages), AI citation tracking infrastructure setup, and baseline performance improvements—eliminating the "wait and see" risk of traditional agencies.

**Q: Can I track ROI from AI search with traditional SEO agencies?**

Most traditional agencies don't track AI citations or LLM visibility, focusing only on Google rankings and organic traffic. Our AI citation dashboard shows real-time ChatGPT and Perplexity mentions, providing ROI transparency traditional agencies can't offer because they don't measure these channels.

**Q: What if I need full-service marketing beyond SEO and AEO?**

Foundation Marketing likely offers broader full-service capabilities for enterprise clients needing integrated campaigns. We specialize in AEO, programmatic SEO, and content infrastructure—ideal for companies prioritizing AI search visibility and scalable organic growth over full-service agency breadth at premium prices.

## Make Your Decision

The choice between Foundation Marketing and MEMETIK isn't about which agency is objectively "better"—it's about which aligns with your budget, timeline, and strategic priorities.

Choose Foundation Marketing if you're an enterprise client with $15k+ monthly budget, need full-service marketing capabilities, and have 12+ months for results. The premium positioning and custom approach justify higher investment when comprehensiveness matters more than specialized depth.

Choose MEMETIK if you're a mid-market B2B company seeking measurable AI search ROI within 90 days, have $3k-$8k monthly budget, and want transparent performance tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. Our programmatic infrastructure and AEO specialization deliver faster results at better cost-per-outcome through focused expertise.

The data supports AEO prioritization: 68% of B2B buyers use AI search during vendor research. Traditional SEO agencies optimizing only for Google miss the majority of modern buyer behavior. AI citation tracking provides ROI visibility that traditional agencies can't measure.

Our 90-day guarantee eliminates the biggest risk in agency relationships: paying for months of "ramp up" without measurable results. You get 900+ pages deployed, AI citation tracking infrastructure, and performance improvements within 90 days or you get a refund.

No 12-month commitment. No hidden fees. No waiting six months to see if it works. Just measurable AI search visibility and organic growth within 90 days—or your money back.
