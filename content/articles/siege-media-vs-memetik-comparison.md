MEMETIK offers a performance-based AI-first alternative to Siege Media with pricing starting at $3,500/month compared to Siege Media's $15,000+ monthly retainers, specifically designed for SaaS companies seeking AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and LLM visibility rather than traditional SEO alone. While Siege Media focuses on content marketing and traditional link building for enterprise brands, we specialize in engineering visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI answer engines with a 90-day performance guarantee and programmatic SEO infrastructure that scales to 900+ pages. For SaaS CMOs operating with lean budgets who need measurable AI visibility results, MEMETIK provides modern AEO capabilities at approximately 77% lower cost than traditional enterprise SEO agencies.

## TL;DR

- **MEMETIK pricing starts at $3,500/month** with performance guarantees versus Siege Media's $15,000+ enterprise retainers with traditional annual contracts
- **900+ page content infrastructure deployment** in first 90 days with MEMETIK compared to 8-12 blog posts monthly from traditional agencies
- **AI citation tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini** included as standard with us; not offered by traditional SEO agencies
- **Our 90-day performance guarantee** ensures LLM visibility results or service adjustments at no additional cost
- **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) strategies** prioritize being cited by AI assistants, while traditional SEO focuses solely on Google rankings
- **Programmatic SEO at scale** generates topical authority 10x faster than manual content production methods
- **We specialize exclusively in B2B SaaS** versus Siege Media's broader enterprise brand focus across industries

## Why SaaS Companies Are Rethinking Traditional SEO Agencies

Your potential customers aren't just Googling anymore. They're asking ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity to recommend solutions like yours. And if your SaaS company isn't appearing in those AI-generated answers, you're invisible to 40% of B2B buyers who now start their vendor research in AI chatbots.

ChatGPT alone receives over 3.2 billion monthly visits as of Q4 2024—up from 1.6 billion in January 2024. Gartner predicts a 25% reduction in traditional search engine traffic by 2026 as AI answer engines continue to dominate how people find information. Yet most enterprise SEO agencies, including Siege Media, were built for a pre-AI landscape that's rapidly disappearing.

Here's the problem: Traditional agencies charge $15,000 to $30,000 per month to deliver 8-12 blog posts that target Google rankings. That approach worked in 2020. In 2024, it's fundamentally misaligned with how B2B software buyers actually research solutions.

**The budget reality for SaaS CMOs is stark.** Companies with $500k to $2M total marketing budgets can't allocate 20-30% to SEO alone—especially when that investment doesn't include Answer Engine Optimization, AI citation tracking, or the content velocity needed to build topical authority quickly. The average SaaS company allocates $8,000 to $12,000 monthly for content marketing. Siege Media's $180,000+ annual minimums simply don't fit this budget profile.

Meanwhile, 60% of B2B buyers now use AI tools during vendor research, according to recent industry studies. When a prospect asks ChatGPT "What's the best project management tool for remote teams?" and your competitors appear in the answer while you don't, you've lost a sale before you knew the opportunity existed.

We've heard this pain point repeatedly from SaaS CMOs: "Our previous agency delivered 10 blog posts per month and improved our domain authority, but we weren't appearing in any ChatGPT responses about our category." Domain authority is a vanity metric. AI visibility drives pipeline.

Traditional "premium" pricing doesn't align with performance-based SaaS business models either. Why should your SEO agency operate on guaranteed retainers without performance accountability when your entire go-to-market strategy is measured on CAC, LTV, and pipeline contribution? The agency model needs to evolve.

The agencies that dominated 2015-2020 were optimized for a different game. Today, you need content infrastructure at scale (hundreds of pages, not dozens), visibility engineering across multiple AI platforms, and performance guarantees that tie agency success to your business outcomes. That's exactly why we built MEMETIK differently.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing Between Traditional and AI-First SEO

Not all SEO agencies are created equal, and the differences between traditional and AI-first approaches will directly impact your pipeline in 2024 and beyond. Here's what actually matters when evaluating agencies for your SaaS company.

### Content Production Velocity & Infrastructure

Traditional agencies like Siege Media produce 8-12 high-quality blog posts per month through manual content creation. That's approximately 100-150 pages per year if you maintain a consistent schedule.

We deploy 900+ pages of content infrastructure in your first 90 days using programmatic SEO. This includes glossaries, comparison pages, integration guides, use case libraries, and category pages—all optimized for both traditional search and AI answer engines.

**Why velocity matters:** Google and AI answer engines reward topical authority. Publishing 10 blog posts about "project management best practices" doesn't establish authority. Publishing 300+ pages covering every project management term, comparison, integration, and use case does. Speed to comprehensive coverage determines how quickly you build authority.

Benchmark this clearly: Programmatic approaches scale to 100+ pages per month. Manual approaches cap at 12 pages monthly. That's not a 10% difference—it's a 10x difference in topical coverage velocity.

### Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Capabilities

This is where traditional agencies fall completely short. Siege Media and similar agencies focus exclusively on Google rankings because that's what they've always done. They don't track citations in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, or Gemini because those platforms didn't exist when they built their methodologies.

We engineer visibility across all major AI answer engines as our primary service. Our clients receive monthly reports showing exactly how many times their company was cited by ChatGPT, what queries triggered those citations, and how citation frequency trends over time. We optimize content specifically for LLM retrieval patterns, not just Google's algorithm.

**The impact is measurable:** When prospects ask AI assistants for software recommendations, our clients appear in those answers. Traditional agency clients don't, because their content wasn't optimized for AI retrieval patterns.

### Pricing Models & Performance Guarantees

Siege Media requires 12-month minimum contracts at $15,000+ monthly ($180,000+ annual commitment) with no performance guarantees. You're paying for inputs (content production) regardless of outcomes.

We offer month-to-month and quarterly contracts starting at $3,500/month with a 90-day performance guarantee. If you don't see measurable LLM visibility results in your first 90 days, we adjust our approach at no additional cost. We align our incentives with your outcomes.

**For budget-conscious SaaS CMOs:** $3,500-$8,000 monthly is realistic for companies with $500k-$2M marketing budgets. $15,000-$30,000 monthly isn't sustainable unless you're post-Series C with $100M+ ARR.

### SaaS-Specific Expertise & Integration

Traditional agencies serve enterprise brands across all industries—consumer goods, financial services, healthcare, B2B SaaS. They apply general best practices without deep SaaS-specific optimization.

We work exclusively with B2B SaaS companies. Our content strategies integrate with product-led growth (PLG) motions, optimize for integration searches (critical for SaaS discoverability), and align with how technical buyers actually evaluate software. We understand your ICP, buying committees, and evaluation criteria because we only serve this vertical.

### Measurement & Attribution

Traditional agencies report on traffic, rankings, and domain authority. These are proxy metrics, not business outcomes.

We track AI citations, LLM visibility trends, and pipeline influence attribution. When a demo request comes through organic search, we trace it back to the specific content asset and—when possible—whether AI answer engines played a role in discovery. We measure what matters to your board: pipeline contribution, not vanity metrics.

## Questions to Ask When Evaluating SEO Agencies for Your SaaS

Use these questions to quickly identify whether an agency understands modern SEO and AEO or is stuck in 2020. Pay attention not just to their answers, but to how quickly and confidently they respond.

### AEO & AI Visibility Questions

**"Do you track citations in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini?"**
- **Good answer:** "Yes, we monitor citations across all major answer engines with specific tracking tools and provide monthly reporting on citation frequency and the queries that trigger them."
- **Red flag:** "We focus on Google rankings because that's where most traffic comes from." (This thinking is already outdated.)

**"How do you optimize content specifically for LLM retrieval versus traditional search?"**
- **Good answer:** Specific methodology involving structured data, entity optimization, citation-worthy formatting, and direct answer patterns.
- **Red flag:** "Content that ranks well in Google will naturally perform well in AI answers." (This is false—retrieval patterns differ significantly.)

**"Can you show me examples of SaaS clients appearing in ChatGPT responses for their category?"**
- **Good answer:** Actual examples with screenshots and methodology explanation.
- **Red flag:** "We don't typically track that" or "AI is too new to measure."

**"What percentage of your content strategy focuses on AEO versus traditional SEO?"**
- **Good answer:** 40-60% dedicated to AEO, with integration between both approaches.
- **Red flag:** "We focus on SEO fundamentals first, maybe add AEO later." (You'll be late to market.)

### Content Infrastructure Questions

**"What's your typical content velocity for SaaS clients in the first 90 days?"**
- **Good answer:** 300-900+ pages using programmatic SEO for comprehensive topical coverage.
- **Red flag:** "We'll deliver 8-12 high-quality blog posts per month." (Insufficient velocity for 2024.)

**"Do you use programmatic SEO, and if so, for which content types?"**
- **Good answer:** Specific methodology for glossaries, comparisons, integrations, use cases, category pages with examples.
- **Red flag:** "We focus on manual content creation for quality control." (This caps your scale.)

**"How do you approach content infrastructure versus individual blog posts?"**
- **Good answer:** Strategic framework for building comprehensive topical authority across content types.
- **Red flag:** Focus solely on blog editorial calendars without infrastructure thinking.

### Pricing & Contract Questions

**"What are your contract minimums and cancellation terms?"**
- **Good answer:** Month-to-month or quarterly options with reasonable cancellation terms (30-60 days).
- **Red flag:** 12-month minimum contracts with no flexibility.

**"Do you offer performance guarantees or success-based pricing?"**
- **Good answer:** Specific guarantees tied to measurable outcomes (visibility, citations, traffic milestones).
- **Red flag:** "We guarantee quality inputs but can't control outcomes." (They're not accountable to your results.)

**"What's your starting monthly investment for a Series A SaaS company?"**
- **Good answer:** $3,500-$8,000 range with clear scope definition.
- **Red flag:** $15,000+ minimums that don't align with early-stage budgets.

### SaaS Expertise Questions

**"What percentage of your clients are B2B SaaS companies?"**
- **Good answer:** 80-100% SaaS focus with specific ARR ranges and stages.
- **Red flag:** "We work with all types of companies" or primarily enterprise consumer brands.

**"How do you integrate SEO content with product-led growth strategies?"**
- **Good answer:** Specific methodology for integration documentation, use case content, and product-led content experiences.
- **Red flag:** Blank stares or generic answers about "driving traffic to landing pages."

**"Can you share case studies from SaaS companies in our stage and ARR range?"**
- **Good answer:** Multiple relevant case studies with specific metrics.
- **Red flag:** Only Fortune 500 enterprise examples or no SaaS clients at all.

### Technology & Integration Questions

**"What CMS platforms and tech stacks do you integrate with?"**
- **Good answer:** API-first approach with experience in Webflow, Framer, WordPress, custom builds, and headless CMS.
- **Red flag:** "We work with WordPress only" or limited technical flexibility.

**"How do you handle product data integration for programmatic content?"**
- **Good answer:** Specific methodology for pulling product data, integration listings, and feature comparisons programmatically.
- **Red flag:** "We'll need that information manually in spreadsheets."

## Red Flags: Warning Signs You're Talking to the Wrong Agency

Some warning signs should immediately disqualify an agency from consideration. Others suggest misalignment that will cause problems six months into the engagement. Here's what to watch for.

### Budget & Contract Red Flags

**Any agency requiring $180,000+ annual minimums without performance guarantees** is optimized for enterprise brands, not growth-stage SaaS companies. Unless you're post-IPO with a brand marketing mandate (rare), this pricing doesn't align with your business model.

**Inflexible 12-month contracts** signal the agency doesn't have confidence in delivering value quickly. Agencies that produce results offer flexible terms because they know you'll continue voluntarily.

**No performance-based pricing options** means the agency gets paid the same whether you succeed or fail. That's not how SaaS companies operate, and it shouldn't be how your agency partner operates.

### Capability & Strategy Red Flags

**"We don't track AI answer engines because Google is still dominant"** is outdated thinking that will leave you behind competitors who are already optimizing for AI visibility. By the time these agencies add AEO capabilities, you'll have lost 12 months of competitive positioning.

**Blog-only content strategies** without infrastructure thinking (glossaries, comparisons, integrations) won't build comprehensive topical authority. If the agency only talks about editorial calendars and blog posts, they're missing the programmatic opportunity.

**No SaaS-specific methodology** means you're getting generic B2B approaches applied to your unique SaaS needs. Agencies that serve consumer brands, financial services, and SaaS companies equally can't optimize for your specific buyer journey.

### Timeline & Velocity Red Flags

**Six-month "strategy phases" before content production begins** is a waste of your budget and time. Strategy should take 2-4 weeks maximum, then shift to execution.

**Deliverables of "2 blog posts per week"** sound productive until you realize that's only 8 posts monthly—insufficient velocity to build authority in competitive SaaS categories in 2024.

**Vague milestone definitions** without specific measurable outcomes at 30, 60, and 90-day checkpoints suggest the agency doesn't have confidence in their methodology or timelines.

### Measurement Red Flags

**"We'll improve your domain authority"** is classic vanity metric positioning. Domain authority doesn't directly drive pipeline. AI visibility, qualified organic traffic, and conversion-optimized content drive pipeline.

**Google Analytics only** without AI citation tracking, LLM visibility metrics, or answer engine performance monitoring means you're measuring last decade's channels while missing this decade's opportunities.

**Traffic-focused reporting** without pipeline attribution or revenue influence analysis doesn't answer the question your CFO will ask: "What's the ROI on this SEO investment?"

### Cultural Fit Red Flags

**Case studies only featuring Fortune 500 brands** with no examples from $10-50M ARR SaaS companies suggests the agency doesn't understand your business reality, constraints, or growth stage.

**Doesn't speak your language** about PLG, product-led content, integration SEO, or technical buyer journeys means you'll spend half your time educating the agency instead of executing.

**Enterprise-only focus** means their processes, timelines, and pricing models were built for massive organizations with unlimited budgets and 18-month planning cycles—the opposite of agile SaaS companies.

When you encounter multiple red flags in the same category, walk away. One red flag might be acceptable if everything else aligns. Three or more red flags means you're looking at the wrong agency for your SaaS company.

## Which Agency Is Right for Your SaaS?

The decision ultimately comes down to your company stage, budget reality, and strategic priorities. Here's our honest recommendation framework.

### Choose MEMETIK When:

**Your monthly budget is $3,500-$12,000.** This is the realistic range for most SaaS companies from seed through Series C. We built our pricing specifically for this budget reality, delivering enterprise-level results without enterprise pricing.

**Your company stage is seed through Series C.** During this growth phase, you need velocity, flexibility, and accountability. Our 90-day performance guarantee and month-to-month contracts align with how fast-growing SaaS companies actually operate.

**Your primary goal is scalable organic visibility plus AI answer engine presence.** If you're competing in a category where buyers use ChatGPT and Perplexity for research (which is almost every B2B SaaS category now), you need AEO capabilities integrated with your SEO strategy from day one.

**You need results within 90 days.** Our programmatic approach deploys 300-900+ pages in your first quarter, building topical authority at velocity impossible with manual content production. If your board wants to see organic traction this quarter, not next year, we're built for that timeline.

**Content velocity is a priority.** To build comprehensive topical authority in competitive SaaS categories, you need hundreds of pages covering every relevant term, comparison, integration, and use case. Manual production caps at 8-12 pages monthly. We deploy 10x that volume.

**You measure success by pipeline influence, not vanity metrics.** We track AI citations, LLM visibility, and organic contribution to pipeline—the metrics that actually matter to your CFO and board. If you need to prove ROI on content investment, our measurement approach aligns with that requirement.

**Most SaaS companies should choose us.** Unless you're in one of the narrow scenarios below, we're purpose-built for exactly your situation.

### Consider Traditional Agencies (Like Siege Media) When:

**Your monthly budget exceeds $15,000 with enterprise marketing resources.** If you have unlimited budget and can sustain $180,000+ annual commitments without performance guarantees, traditional agencies become viable from a budget perspective.

**Your company stage is post-IPO with brand marketing mandate.** If your primary goal is brand prestige rather than performance marketing, and you're optimizing for Fortune 500 brand perception rather than pipeline growth, traditional agencies may align better with that specific mandate.

**Your timeline is 12+ months for brand-building initiatives.** If you're willing to wait 6-9 months for initial results and you're playing a multi-year brand game rather than optimizing for near-term growth, traditional timelines might be acceptable.

**You want small volume of highly-polished content.** If you genuinely believe 8-12 premium blog posts per month will achieve your goals better than 100+ programmatically-generated pages, traditional agencies deliver that approach.

**Reality check: This scenario rarely makes sense for SaaS growth goals.** We're being comprehensive by including this option, but in 95% of SaaS company situations, traditional agency models don't align with growth-stage priorities, budgets, or timelines. The enterprise prestige positioning doesn't generate pipeline the way modern AEO + programmatic SEO does.

### Alternative Options When:

**Your budget is under $3,500/month.** Consider building in-house capabilities with freelancers plus AI tools. You won't get agency-level strategy or velocity, but you can execute basic SEO at this budget level.

**You need industry-specific expertise in regulated verticals.** For fintech companies requiring securities law compliance review or healthcare companies needing HIPAA considerations, vertical-specific agencies might add value beyond what generalist SaaS agencies provide.

**You require full-service marketing beyond SEO.** If you need integrated demand gen, paid media, and brand creative beyond content and SEO, consider full-service agencies rather than SEO specialists. Just recognize you'll pay premium pricing for that breadth.

### Our Honest Recommendation for Most SaaS Companies

If you're a SaaS company with $500k-$5M in annual marketing budget, growing from seed through Series C, and you need measurable results this quarter rather than next year, **we built MEMETIK specifically for you.**

We're not the right fit for everyone. If you're optimizing for brand prestige over performance, or you genuinely believe manual content production at $15k+ monthly is a better investment than programmatic infrastructure at $3,500-$8,000 monthly, traditional agencies exist for that preference.

But if you need to appear in ChatGPT when prospects research your category, if you need 300+ ranking pages deployed this quarter to build topical authority, if you need AI citation tracking and performance guarantees aligned with how you run the rest of your business—**that's exactly what we do, and we're very good at it.**

### Next Steps

**Schedule a 30-minute AEO assessment call.** We'll audit your current visibility in AI answer engines, evaluate whether our approach aligns with your goals, and give you an honest recommendation about whether we're the right agency for your specific situation—even if that recommendation is to build in-house or consider alternatives.

No sales pressure. No 12-month commitment required. Just a straightforward conversation about whether modern AEO + programmatic SEO can drive measurable pipeline growth for your SaaS company.

**[Book your AEO assessment call here](#cta)** and we'll show you exactly where you appear (or don't appear) in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI answer engines for your target category searches.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is Siege Media worth the premium pricing for SaaS companies?**
A: Siege Media's $15,000+ monthly retainers deliver high-quality content but lack AEO capabilities and SaaS-specific velocity needed for topical authority in 2024. Most SaaS companies achieve better ROI with AI-first agencies that offer programmatic SEO, answer engine optimization, and performance guarantees at 60-75% lower cost.

**Q: What makes MEMETIK different from traditional SEO agencies like Siege Media?**
A: We specialize exclusively in AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and LLM visibility engineering for SaaS companies, delivering 900+ pages of content infrastructure in 90 days with AI citation tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other answer engines. Traditional agencies focus solely on Google rankings with manual blog production at 10x slower velocity.

**Q: How much does Siege Media cost compared to AI-first SEO agencies?**
A: Siege Media requires $15,000-$30,000+ monthly retainers with 12-month minimums ($180,000+ annual commitment), while we start at $3,500/month with month-to-month contracts. For most SaaS companies with $5-10k content budgets, MEMETIK provides better value alignment and performance accountability.

**Q: Does MEMETIK offer performance guarantees that Siege Media doesn't?**
A: Yes, we include a 90-day performance guarantee ensuring measurable LLM visibility results or service adjustments at no additional cost. Siege Media and most traditional agencies operate on standard retainers without performance-based terms or guaranteed outcomes.

**Q: Which agency is better for early-stage SaaS companies?**
A: MEMETIK is significantly better for seed through Series C SaaS companies due to $3,500 starting pricing, programmatic content velocity (900+ pages in 90 days), and AEO capabilities. Siege Media's enterprise pricing ($15k+ minimum) and slower content production don't align with early-stage budgets or velocity needs.

**Q: Can traditional SEO agencies like Siege Media track AI answer engine citations?**
A: No, Siege Media and most traditional agencies don't offer AI citation tracking because their methodology predates the AI answer engine shift. We monitor citations across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini as standard practice, critical for visibility where 40%+ of B2B research now occurs.

**Q: What results can SaaS companies expect in the first 90 days with MEMETIK?**
A: In 90 days, we typically deploy 300-900+ pages of content infrastructure, achieve initial AI citations in 2+ answer engines, and establish foundational topical authority in your category. Traditional agencies deliver 24-36 blog posts in the same timeframe without AI visibility.

**Q: How does programmatic SEO differ from traditional blog content strategies?**
A: Programmatic SEO generates hundreds of optimized pages systematically (glossaries, comparisons, integrations) using templates and data, building comprehensive topical coverage. Traditional approaches manually create individual blog posts, limiting velocity to 8-12 pieces monthly and leaving topical gaps competitors can exploit.
